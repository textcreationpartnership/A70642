            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe Collections being the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues of ſome of my Forein Rambles in the Late Times, whilſt our Inteſtine Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties rendered it infectious to abide within the Air of them, and laid aſide amongſt my neglected Papers, have run the riſque of being ſtifled in their birth; when looking about me, and finding nothing conſiderable of this Story made publike by any other hand, I fancied (I think not unreaſonably) that it might, under the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of being divertive, appear abroad in the croud, without too much expoſing its Author. Beſides, I found ſo much paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel betwixt theſe Troubles and thoſe of my Native Country, which by a Providence not many degrees ſhort of Miracle, is but lately reſcued (I may ſay, uninchanted) from an Impoſture of more Artifice and Delicacie, by how much it is more difficult
<pb facs="tcp:93173:4"/>for one perſon to vary his ſhapes to the ſame eyes, than for thoſe eyes to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by variety of perſons, that I have here thought good to preſent the world with ſome Obſervations of the later ſort. The Scene of what I write was laid in the great Empire of <hi>Muſkovy,</hi> which, in the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of man hath laboured under an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture no leſs ſtrange in its birth, than admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in its productions; and if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the various viciſſitudes of the Actors in it, not only ſurpaſſing what former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have delivered of this kind, but hardly to be parallel'd by Poſterity, unleſs it had already happened. For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Hiſtory, I have thought fit to premiſe ſomewhat, but briefly, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; upon no other deſigne than that of gratifying ſuch as are leſs verſed in the Manners and Government of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>The vaſt Continent of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> extends from the <hi>Frozen Ocean</hi> to the <hi>Caſpian Sea;</hi> being alſo bordered upon by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the <hi>Poles,</hi> and the <hi>Tartars.</hi> The length of it from the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Ob</hi> to the Town of <hi>Czerkaſſy,</hi> is accounted <hi>1520</hi> Engliſh Miles: and its breadth from <hi>Corelenburg</hi> in the Confines of <hi>Finland</hi> to <hi>Lepin, 300
<pb facs="tcp:93173:4"/>German,</hi> or <hi>1200</hi> Engliſh Miles. This great Territory is divided into many large Provinces, which give alſo names to, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them from their principal Cities; the Chief whereof is that of <hi>Moſkwa,</hi> ſo called by the Inhabitants, and by us <hi>Muſko,</hi> from whence alſo the whole Region is called <hi>Muſkovy.</hi> The Country is ſandy and plain, but welnigh impaſſable, by reaſon of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Lakes and Rivers, ſave in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is long, and inſufferably cold; but most of their Commerce is driven then, upon their Sleds and Ice. The Summer is in its turn as violently hot, and ſeems the more intenſe by reaſon of its ſhort ſtay; ſufficing howſoever to ripen their Herbage, and Corn, and Fruits; eſpecially ſuch as ſurvived the rigor of the cold. It abounds in Flax and Hemp, and an immenſe quantity of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the Woods, which are many and great, being filled with ſwarms of Bees, as alſo of Birds and of wild Beaſts; the precious Furs of the later bring in ſuch high eſteem in the world. The Inhabitants (we will except thoſe of the firſt Rank) are barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, yet cunning, unfaithful, immeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly debauched, luxurious, cruel; and yet ſo ſervile, that they glory in it. The Nobility think it an honour to be eſteemed the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:93173:5"/>abject of Slaves to their Princes; but they again inſult and tyrannize over their Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, though all acknowledge the Deſpotick power of their Duke; who is ſo abſolute, that he is Sovereign of the lives and fortunes of every individual; being fettered by no Law but that of his will, which is as exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as his pleaſure. In a word, there is no Government in the world where the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the Prince and the Servitude of the People are greater. For all this, He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of a precarious Council, many of them of the Clergy, the better to impoſe upon the ignorant and ſuperſtitious Commonalty, who think nothing Sacred that they have not conſented to, nor nothing hard that has their approbation. Their chief Strength conſiſts in their Cavalry, all Gentlemens Sons: for none are eſteemed Noble, who do not ſerve in the War. When all theſe meet, they are accounted <hi>80000;</hi> and that is as oft as the Great Duke pleaſeth: theſe have Land and Stipends allotted for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The Foot all Fire-men, are <hi>12000</hi> in ordinary pay; nor are there any Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers imployed, but upon extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. Whereas our chief care is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Victuals for our Armies, their Prince takes none at all for his; every Souldier
<pb facs="tcp:93173:5"/>being his own Purveyor, and content with a little, ſcarce uſing any thing but Bisket and Meal. If they were as brave as they are ſtrong, and underſtood War as well as hardſhip, what could reſiſt their numbers and power? But they are heavy, and ſo addicted to ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that they ſcarce deſire, ſeldom acquire any great matters. Yet they have one other excellent quality, eſpecially in Garriſon, tenacious even to obſtinacie, as appears, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with most of their other Virtues and Vices, in the ſequel of this Narrative. This, as most other Countries, was at first govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many and ſeveral petty Princes and Lords, until most truckling to the felicity of a few, theſe again did by Alliances and Conqueſts devolve upon one. <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Baſilius</hi> was the first that aſſumed the Title of Prince of all <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> having not only reduced all others to his obedience, but ſhaken off the <hi>Tartars</hi> yoke, from whom his Predeceſſors received their Scepters and Power. His Son <hi>Baſilius</hi> equally happy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the fair Provinces of <hi>Smolensko</hi> and <hi>Pleſcow</hi> to his Dominions, with the Honor of <hi>Knez,</hi> King and Emperor, to his Titles. <hi>John</hi> ſucceeded him, who adding Induſtry and Diſcipline to the Arts of his Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, conquered the Kingdoms of <hi>Cazan</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93173:6"/>and <hi>Aſtracan,</hi> and extended his Empire to the Confines of <hi>Perſia.</hi> But he was no leſs cruel than brave; which did much aſperſe the glory of ſo many Victories. But this Prince being his Father, whoſe Story we write, we will refer the rest of him, and the Reader, to the ſubſequent Relation.</p>

            <p>The Great Dutcheſs, a Lady of a Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Preſence and Carriage, was Siſter to <hi>Boris Gedanow,</hi> Maſter of the Horſe; who (by the joynt Advantages of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Quality, added to the dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Addreſs and Contrivances; to all which Conſpired the Infirmneſs of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus</hi> his Conſtitution, and the eaſineſs of his Nature) had gained an entire poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Government. This Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Favorite having, by his Siſters Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and his own Skill, gathered into his Manage the greateſt Concerns of the State, had thereby the opportunity of obliging or removing the chief Officers of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire at pleaſure. And whether having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the ſweetneſs of Dominion, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily quitted with much reluctancy; or that he had from the Death of his old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter laid his deſigns of placing the Crown upon his own head, is ſcarce queſtionable. However it was, the way ſeemed already ſmoothed by the indiſpoſition of the Duke, and the acquired favour of the Nobility, who, preferments paſſing through his hands, gave them a neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93173:9"/>upon him; none being advanced to any place of Honor or Truſt, but as they were preſented by this Prince-miniſter. Add to this, that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, though Married in his Fathers life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, who by reaſon of his Wives Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs had oft commanded him to put her away; (a Practice conſiſtent with the Power of thoſe Princes:) but he conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more his Affection than his Intereſt, had all that time delayed it: and now what the Dutcheſs by her Influence had before exerciſed for the raiſing of her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Great Dukes Favour, is by his inſinuations upon the Affections and Paſſions of the Prince returned to her with advantage, who for his ſake conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued her, as he had formerly for hers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him. He had indeed attained to a very great perfection in the Art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which with the powerful Charms of Flattery and a well-diſſembled paſſion for his Maſters Intereſt, as it rendered <hi>Boris</hi> abſolute in his greatneſs, ſo it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Empire ſecure in the Fidelity and Watchfulneſs of ſo excellent a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that laying aſide the preſent Care of his Dominions, he was conſequently as little thoughtful of a Succeſſor; but indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93173:9"/>himſelf in his private Pleaſures and Retirements, he became inſenſibly deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Majeſty of one of the Greateſt Princes of the Chriſtian World. The main obſtacle to the growing Ambition of <hi>Boris,</hi> was the Life of <hi>Demetrius</hi> Brother to the great Duke, and Heir apparent to the Crown. His deſtruction was therefore judged neceſſary to precede, in whom the Blood-Royal determined; there would want only the death of the Great Duke, to make way for the Election of a new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. And the Conſtitution of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment then conſidered, <hi>Boris</hi> might reaſonably propoſe to himſelf the ſuffrages of the Nobles and People, who were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by his Counſels, and imployed or diſcontinued in order to his Intereſts and Deſigns. Bloody Tyrants never want Bloody Inſtruments (witneſs that moſt horrid of Murthers perpetrated in our own Land upon the beſt of Princes) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any Relation proof againſt the Charms of Ambition and Avarice in a degenerate mind. <hi>Boris</hi> by the aid of vaſt Preſents, and promiſes of greater, had gained four of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Servants to murther their Lord. The horridneſs of ſo ſad an Aſſaſſination made them for ſome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93173:10"/>time ſuſpend its execution, till hurried on by a conſideration that they were too far advanced to retreat with ſafety, by threats of the Tyrant, and by the hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſuddenly Great, they reſolved upon the cruel performance of what they had ſo wretchedly undertaken. All the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty now is, how it ſhould be compaſſed; and ſeveral ways being propoſed, they at length conclude, as followeth. An ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure gloomy Night is made choyce of, as moſt proper and ſutable to ſo black a deed; and the Town being ſet on fire in many places at once, theſe miſcreants fill all with Tumult, and the terror of the Burning. This done, they fling themſelves like men amazed into the Princes Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, and awaking him with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fright, alarm his already-diſturbed Spirits with the approaching danger. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> ſtarts up at the noiſe, and running to the window to ſee the Flames, is ſet upon by thoſe he truſted moſt, and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſeveral places of his Body with long poyſoned knives prepared for this inhumane Butchery. While the unhappy Child lay wallowing in his Blood, and ſtrugling with his Fate, theſe Villians, by the advantage of the Night, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93173:10"/>they had raiſed, and upon Horſes laid for them, poſted to <hi>Boris</hi> with the news of the execution of his Command, and to receive their promiſed Salary. The Tyrant upon the firſt advertiſement la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under the Impreſſions of his Joy, received theſe Bloody Miniſters of his will with no ordinary tranſport; till the heat of that Paſſion being ſpent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon what he had done; as it is the Nature of Guilt and Treaſon never to think it ſelf ſecure, he thought likewiſe his Practices might come to light: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolved theſe miſcreants ſhould not diſcover them, he by the temptation of exceſſive rewards hired other Executioners to deſtroy and make away theſe four firſt Murtherers. And that he might not be engaged upon new contrivances, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns the ſame Method for their Ruine, which they had ſquared out for the death of the Prince: in order whereto, as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecz</hi> was Sacrificed to his deſtruction, ſo <hi>Musko</hi> was put into flames for theirs. The Town is fired in many places at once, ſome hundreds of Houſes buried in their own Aſhes, while theſe hated Traytors were (though by unjuſt means) puniſhed with a juſt retaliation for their execrable Villany.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93173:11"/>
            <p>But to return to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>glecz.</hi> As ſoon as the Fire was quenched, and that the Citizens began to be Compoſed from their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, a Rumor being ſpread that their Prince was Murthered, they violently break into the Caſtle; and finding what they feared to be true indeed, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction being now heightened to Fury and Outrage, they ſlaughtered all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants without diſtinction or enquiry: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the careleſneſs and neglect of the Innocent, no leſs culpable than the perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous induſtry of the Guilty, they thought happily to purge themſelves from the ſtain of the Fact, by their zeal in revenging it. But in vain: for <hi>Boris,</hi> to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf if any durſt ſuſpect him, and to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalize his pretended Paſſion to his Prince, made uſe of this Irregular vengeance of the Citizens as an Argument of their Guilt; and laying the Murther at their door, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had ſlain all thoſe from whom inquiſition might have been made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it without examining them at all, he cauſed them to be proceeded againſt as Criminals. Many of the chief amongſt them were tortured, hanged, drowned, Baniſhed, and expoſed as examples of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Juſtice; while he (the better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93173:11"/>his cruelty) under the ſence of ſo irreparable a loſs, veſts himſelf and the whole Court in mourning; And having diſpatched Duke <hi>Baſilius Zuisky</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prime Senators and Perſons of Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, with Orders to Celebrate his Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies with all the Funebrial Pomp and Honour imaginable, he commanded that the very place of his Death (as guilty in failing to protect him) might not ſurvive to be a witneſs to ſo great a loſs, but (as Infamous) be immediately razed, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> being thus removed, <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> did not long ſurvive him; and 'tis more than conjectural, that his end was haſtened by the impatience of <hi>Boris,</hi> and the violence of a ſecret poyſon. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was, the Duke ſenſible of his weakneſs, and the approach of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, bequeathed the Government of the Empire to the conduct of the Lady <hi>Irena</hi> his Wife, ſiſter to <hi>Boris:</hi> the Patriarch was appointed her Aſſiſtant, and both of them by the dying Prince recommended to the Valour and Fidelity of the Great ones of his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodorus</hi> being dead, and the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Funerals performed with all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93173:12"/>Ceremonies and Circumſtances, his Dutcheſs did readily aſcend the Throne: but afterwards having ſome time toyled under the weight of ſo Great an Empire, whether out of unwillingneſs to fuſtain ſo Great a Burthen, or, as is more probable, to ſecure the ſucceſſion in her own Houſe by transferring it upon her Brother, ſhe declares her reſolutions to quit ſo unequal a Charge: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly yeilds up the Enſigns of her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority into the hands of the Nobles, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out, that for the Repoſe of her Soul ſhe would Sequeſter her ſelf from the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyls of this World into the Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a private Life. This news being ſpread amongſt the people, did infinitely perplex them: for though they might have ſome reluctancy againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Woman, or that the ſervility of their Nature might at other times ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them patient of any Yoke; yet they wiſely conſidered it more ſafe to ſubmit to one, than many Tyrants. <hi>Boris</hi> in the mean time laid his trayns at diſtance, chuſing rather to have the Government devolve upon him by neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, than rudely to break in upon it; cheriſhes (by his ſecret Agents and Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93173:12"/>the mutinous Temper of the People, who without an head were become uneaſie to themſelves as well as others. This ſubtile States-man had in the interim withdrawn himſelf from all publique buſineſs, to the retirements of a Countrey-houſe. All things in this State had a tendency towards confuſion; ſome not daring, others not willing to lay hold upon the Government: and indeed, all the prime Miniſters being raiſed by his Favour, not ſecure in the Counſels of each other, were emulous who ſhould firſt conduct him to the Throne. In order whereto, they attend him with their Submiſſions and Addreſſes that he will take upon him the protection of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted State. The people tranſported by the apprehenſions of their Ruine, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded the Nobility with their Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. The Clergy, whoſe ſafety conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Peace of the Empire, brought in their Supplications. The Nuns quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Cloyſters, and inſtead of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their exquiſite Artiſt, offer up their Prayers to him as their Tutelary Saint or Angel. The very Children, as if ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Supernatural Impulſion, beſieged him with Tears and Cries. And what he denied to all theſe Sollicitations either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93173:13"/>or united, ſuppoſing them to have a reſpect to him only, not to themſelves; he grants, as he declared, to the neceſſity of his Country; which being without a Head, and no man willing to undertake the care, he muſt offer violence to his own nature, rather than expoſe ſo glorious an Empire as a prey to every Invader. Who could all this while, under ſo dark a Veil, ſuſpect him guilty of Poyſoning his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and the Murther of his Prince, to make way for his Crown, preſented to him ſeveral times in vain by all the Orders of the Empire? But permitting himſelf at length to be overcome, he proteſted that he had given that to their importunity and the love of his Country, which he ſhould for ever have denied to his own Honor and Greatneſs, and the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Houſe to ſo Illuſtrious a Rank. He confeſſed himſelf too weak for ſo great a Burthen; but Courting the Aid of his Petitioners to his Aſſiſtance, he promiſed his utmoſt Endeavours to anſwer the obligingneſs of ſo Unanimous and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable an Election, wherewith they were pleaſed to ſignalize him above his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: And ſince they had marked him out for their Emperour, he would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93173:13"/>Queſtion their Judgment, but chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receive the Honour of that Truſt; which he would die rather than betray or relinquiſh, but into their hands who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to him. He aſſured them, that where he could not equal his Predeceſſors in Glory and Merit, he would ſurpaſs them in Temperance, Evenneſs of Government, and the Impartial diſtribution of Juſtice to his People; as deriving his Greatneſs from their choice, and dedicating it wholly to their Service and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boris</hi> being thus come to the Crown, ſhewed no leſs wiſdom and conduct in conſerving his Dignity, than he had exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the acquiring of it: he ſecured the Army and men of War to him by Gifts; the Nobles, by Preferments, Favours and ſutable Graces; and the Commonalty, by a diminution of their Taxes, increaſe of their Priviledges, protection and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Trade, and in all things by a gentle hand upon the Reins of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; whereby he was become the Darling of his people, and the Honour of that Crown they had given him. He had an eye to the ſtate of his Affairs abroad; in order whereto, he was careful to renew the Treaties with the <hi>Swede, Pole,</hi> the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93173:14"/>
               <hi>Perſian,</hi> and neighbouring <hi>Tartar;</hi> and being ſecure beyond humane apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the contrary at home and abroad, he is from the Contrivances and Deſignes of a private Monk in a Cloyſter hurried into thoſe diſcords and perplexities which no forein Enemy with all his Powers could have reduced him to.</p>
            <p>This Monks right name (if we believe the contrary party) was <hi>Hrisko Otropeia,</hi> born a Gentleman, but of a decayed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in the Dukedome of <hi>Jareſlaw.</hi> The debaucheries of his younger years were extraordinary, which neceſſitated his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to diſpoſe of him into the Cloyſter of <hi>Trinouka,</hi> where he might have room to breath out the extravagancies of his youth by this more rigid converſation. This retiredneſs did not at all quadrate with the licentiouſneſs of <hi>Hrisko's</hi> nature, who being of a Spirit over-active for the Contemplative life he was condemned to, had therewith a very advantageous meen and preſence; which an old ſubtile Frier of that Covent taking notice of, one who had a ſecret Antipathy to the perſon of the Great Duke, though never diſobliged by him (if at all known to him) he contracts a particular friendſhip with this young Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationer;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93173:14"/>and fully inſtructing him in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Chronicle, and with the preſent form of Government, he alſo acquaints him with all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the late Changes in the State, and by what Arts and Aſſaſſinations <hi>Boris</hi> had poſſeſſed himſelf of the Empire. The Frier having thus qualified his Pupil, tempts him away from his Cloyſter and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſecretly conveys him into the Dukedom of <hi>Kiow;</hi> where, with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, he places him in the ſervice of Duke <hi>Adam Wiſnioweski;</hi> furniſhing him with apt Rules for the diſcovery of himſelf when a ſeaſonable opportunity ſhould be offered. <hi>Hrisko</hi> being thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, the Frier leaves him, and returns into <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> giving it out every where, that <hi>Demetrius</hi> the right Heir of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> was yet alive: that his Murther had been deſigned by that bloody Tyrant <hi>Boris,</hi> but that his Mother, the Great Dutcheſs Dowager, having gained private Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Plot, and in that Juncture of Affairs judging no place ſecure againſt the power and malice of the Favorite, thought it more ſafe to avoid the ſtorm, than vainly to reſiſt it: in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſhe cauſed <hi>Demetrius</hi> to be conveyed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93173:15"/>away under the conduct of only one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant privy to his Eſtate; and the better to diſguiſe his flight, had provided ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Child of the ſame Age (a Prieſts Son at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>glecz</hi>) of ſhapes and features not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Prince, whom the Murtherers killed in his ſtead. He affirmed further, That the Corps was ſuddenly Coffined by the wary and honeſt Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, a <hi>German,</hi> privy to this pious fraud, in order to his Interment; whereby the eſcape of the Prince was managed with leſs difficulty; who was at preſent in Duke <hi>Wiſnioweski's</hi> Court in great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and acknowledged and treated as Emperour of <hi>Muſcovy:</hi> That his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were in a good forwardneſs for the recovery of his Rights; and aſſures the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> that if they would eſpouſe his Quarrel, they ſhould ſhare in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and their Pay (for it is a Military Nation) be much bettered. Whilſt the Frier by whiſpers of this kind was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating the peoples inclination to his own Deſignes, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> (for ſo we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after call him) remains in the Dukes Court, in the Quality of his Chamberlain; but not forgetting the Rules his Tutor had left with him, he employs all his ſpare
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93173:15"/>time in the exerciſe of thoſe Qualities and Graces which render Great Perſons more conſiderable; as, riding the great Horſe, Tilting, Fencing, and whatever elſe might bear proportion with that Greatneſs he reſolved to pretend to. His Converſation amongſt his Fellows was reſerved, and yet obliging; towards his Mr. full of Reſpect and Submiſſion, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixture of an Air which ſpoke his Services more the effect of Gratitude than Duty.</p>
            <p>Thus did this apt Scholar demean himſelf in the Court of <hi>Wiſnioweski,</hi> watching all opportunities to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Documents of his Tutor; which by an accident of ſome ſeverity, were ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably offered, and laid hold of by him. For the Duke being one day in a Bath, his Chamberlain had omitted ſome neceſſary circumſtance about his Perſon, wherewith his Choler being raiſed, he ſtrikes him upon the Face, calling him the Son of a Whore. <hi>Demetrius</hi> not at all ſurprized with this uſage, (as if forgetting the Quality of a Servant) ſeemed infinitely perplexed at ſo unkind a Treatment from a perſon his equal at leaſt, if not his inferiour; and the ſcorn and unkindneſs of a Blow from one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93173:16"/>whom he had vouchſafed to ſerve, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting him to a diſcovery of himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a retreat: His Eyes filled with Tears, he breaks forth into theſe words: My Lord, were my Quality as well known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you as my Perſon and Service, your Grace would have ſpared your ill Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and your Blows, both which I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſcorn and grieve at; being that where I promiſed my ſelf a Sanctuary, and Ayds for my Reſtauration, I am diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by this rugged Treatment from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting either. And as recollecting himſelf for having ſaid ſo much, he ſtopt ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Duke being ſtrangely ſurprized by his Servants diſcourſe, and behaviour in this diſcourſe, haſtily aſked him, What mean theſe ambiguous Speeches? Who art thou? Of what Country, and Name? and upon what deſignes art thou here? His haſte by theſe multiplied Queſtions to know all, without permitting <hi>Demetrius</hi> to ſpeak, and anſwer them ſeverally, gave him room to cleer up; and compoſing his Countenance into a more Grave po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, not without a becoming ſadneſs and modeſty, anſwered, That his Country was <hi>Muskcovy;</hi> his Father <hi>John Baſilius</hi> the deceaſed Emperour; his Name <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us;</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93173:16"/>and his Buſineſs there, for Protection and Aid againſt <hi>Boris,</hi> the moſt bloody of Tyrants, who had laid deſignes to murther him, but that by the care of his Mother, and the fidelity of a Servant, he was conveyed away; another Child of his Age, and not unlike him, being laid in his place, whom the Aſſaſſinates killed, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be him. That ſince that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, he had been concealed in a Covent of Monks; till a juſt ambition of getting his own, had tempted him into the world to try what was to be done. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm all this, putting his hand into his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, draws out a rich Croſs of Gold beſet with Diamonds, which he ſaid was the only Teſtimony of Royalty his Mother had left with him upon his eſcape. Then caſting himſelf at the Dukes feet, he breaks forth into theſe Expreſſions: Now Sir, that I have diſcovered to you a Secret of that nature which no Rack could have extorted from me, you are become Maſter of my life and fortunes: neither have I thus expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my ſelf to your knowledge without deſigne, it being equal to me to die, as to wither and languiſh in this ſervile condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if you will make good that confidence which firſt ſwayed me to put my
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93173:17"/>ſelf under your Protection; refuſe me not thoſe favours which I have promiſed my ſelf from your Juſtice and Vertue. Let not the wickedneſs and evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the example receive countenance from ſo juſt a Prince, but give your ſelf the Honour of aſſiſting me to cleanſe my Throne from the uſurpation of a Tyrant, by ſo much the more Ignominious, by how much he ſtands obliged to me, as my Subject and Vaſſal. And for your recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, beſides the having performed ſo good an Act, which brings with it its own rewards, I ſhall think no acknowledgment too dear for you. The Duke aſtoniſhed at this diſcourſe, and at the ſame time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon former paſſages in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of his Servant, which comparing with the ſeeming probability of his narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and his meen in delivering of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Rumour ſpread abroad that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> was yet alive, was at a loſs how to behave himſelf; but being divided in his reſolution, he made a kind of excuſe to his Servant, that not knowing his Quality, he ought to pardon any miſcarriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; and requeſting him to ſtay where he was, till he ſhould ſend to him. He left him very anxious what would be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93173:17"/>determined concerning him. The Duke full of amazement and irreſolution, haſtes to his Ladies Chamber, to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the whole ſtory of his encounter with his Servant <hi>Hrisko.</hi> The Dutcheſs, according to the nature of Women, much pleaſed with the novelty, judged the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very probable, becauſe not altogether impoſſible: and then comparing all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances together, ſhe raiſes her likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to a certainty, that it could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be; that ſhe had ever obſerved in his very Face, the marks of Greatneſs; that he had ever aſpired to noble Qualities; that no Impoſtor could have dared under ſo young years to own ſo hazardous a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; and that therefore it muſt be <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> and no other, who had caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into their arms for Protection, which by all Laws, Divine and Humane, they were obliged to afford him. Thus having determined the matter, care was had for his reception, in a way proportionable to the Greatneſs of his Quality; and the whole Court immediately diſpoſed into a State fit to have received the Great Duke and Emperour of <hi>Muskovy,</hi> that evening. A train of Servants of all ſorts, with horſes for the Saddle and Coach ſuitably accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93173:18"/>were forthwith ordered, and an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment in the moſt honourable part of the houſe was made ready with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable State becoming ſo Great a Prince. This being done, the Duke having loaden twelve Servants with preſents of the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things in his poſſeſſion, and moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the occaſion, himſelf in Perſon uſhers them with much Submiſſion and Ceremony to his late Servant <hi>Hrisko,</hi> conducts him to his Appartment, humbly beſeeching his Highneſs to receive thoſe trifles as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his ſervice, and devotion to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; declaring his reſolution to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all his Powers for the ſetling him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne of his Fathers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> being by this time reaſſured, receives the Dukes Complement with a becoming Reſervedneſs and Civility, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating to him his Engagements; and that when it ſhould pleaſe God to reſtore him to his Dominions, he would give more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Teſtimonies of his reſolutions never to forget ſo ſeaſonable &amp; obliging Favours.</p>
            <p>This extraordinary change in <hi>Wiſnio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weski</hi>'s Court, managed with ſo great Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in the view of the whole world, failed not to juſtifie thoſe Whiſpers ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad by the Old Friers induſtry, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93173:18"/>gave a confirmation of thoſe Rumours diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in the adjacent Kingdoms and Countries: and what before could make no impreſſion upon the faith of the <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,</hi> is now become an Article of it; That <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Son to <hi>John Baſilius,</hi> and right Heir to the Empire of <hi>Musko,</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and in ſafety. But no man appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the report with more Terrour than <hi>Boris;</hi> guilt and fear rendering even impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities conceivable, though he knew not how to reconcile the preſent reports with thoſe had been made unto him by his Aſſaſſinates, and were confirmed by the Solemnities of the Princes Funeral: but being of a preſent Courage and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, laid by his wonders, to make room for his Induſtry and Conduct; and wiſely foreſeeing what great diſorders the Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might produce, if not ſeaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, He immediately poſts away his diſpatches with Preſents to <hi>Wiſnioweski;</hi> beſides an Offer of a perpetual League, and ſeveral Caſtles and Towns upon the Borders, convenient for him, with a vaſt ſum of ready Money, upon condition he would dead or alive ſend him that Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Impoſtor who preſumed to abuſe the world by aſſuming the name and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93173:19"/>of <hi>Demetrius;</hi> warily mixing his Courtſhip with ſome threats, That <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioweski</hi> he hoped was too wiſe to be made a property to gratifie the Malice of any that ſhould dare to interrupt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>Wiſnioweski</hi> was ſo far from being ſwayed by the Meſſages and Temptations of <hi>Boris,</hi> that he became wholly confirmed in what he made ſome doubt of before; and concluding that this ſeeming <hi>Hrisko</hi> was the true <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he reſolves to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe his Cauſe and Intereſt. In order whereto, <hi>Boris</hi> having ſtrong Forces upon the Borders, the Duke with <hi>Demetrius</hi> took Coach immediately, and with ſome Horſe that he had in a readineſs, retires to <hi>Wiſnioweski,</hi> a ſtrong Town of his farther in the Country: being come thither, he puts the Great Dukes Letters into <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> his hands; who having peruſed them, after ſome little pauſe, caſt himſelf at the Dukes feet, and with interrupted words ſaid to him, Sir, I am in Gods hands and in yours; the Fortunes and Perſon of <hi>Demetrius</hi> are at your diſpoſe: but my Truſt is in the Honour of your promiſes, and that the temptations of this Uſurper ſhall have no influence upon your Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Wiſnioweski</hi> raiſed him up with much
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93173:19"/>Humanity and Reſpect, bids him be ſure he would not depart from that faith he had already paſſed to him, for all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in the world; that he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brought him to that place, further out of his Enemies reach, where he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to remain with his Attendants, while himſelf went back to a nearer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>Boris,</hi> in order to a better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his deſignes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boris</hi> being impatient of <hi>Wiſnioweski</hi>'s delays, ſends yet again to him, before the return of his former Agent, with larger offers; but ſuſpecting the Duke was not to be wrought upon, he gave ſecret inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that by ſome Art or other <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> ſhould be privately Murthered or Poyſoned. The Duke by means of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret correſpondent in the Court of <hi>Boris,</hi> having notice of this deſigne, &amp; judging <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſcarce ſafe at ſo near a diſtance, recommends him to the Palatine of <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domiria,</hi> by whom he was received with all imaginable Demonſtrations of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Reſpect and Honour, as due to a Perſon of ſo Illuſtrious Quality. Being thus by the mediation of his ſupporter diſpoſed into a place of better ſecurity, he had more room to reflect upon the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93173:20"/>Documents of his Tutour: And being quick of apprehenſion, cloſe in his nature, and apt to promiſe himſelf a glorious Iſſue to theſe fair beginnings; he nouriſhes his fancy with high Reflections, whereby his thoughts being ſublimated, his very nature was changed into that of Princes. Greatneſs had ſeemed to take poſſeſſion of his Soul; and what by a converſation with perſons of the firſt Rank, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Kingdoms and Empires, the part he Acted was become natural to him. His faculties were pregnant, and his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage not unbecoming the Perſon aſſumed by him. He had an underſtanding above his Age, and a preſence ſo agreeable, that he ſeldome or never loſt ground where he had room to Act his own part. He was not inſenſible of the preſent State of his affairs; that he was fallen into the hands of ſtrangers, who having taken fire at the novelty of his Fortune, would be apt to cool again at the leaſt hard weather that ſhould fall upon it. 'Tis true, he had received very honourable promiſes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from <hi>Wiſnioweski,</hi> but he wiſely conſidered thoſe would depend upon Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of State; and when the Duke ſhould judge it more conducible to his affairs to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93173:20"/>deliver him up, he foreſaw it would be his fate to be the ſacrifice of the Dukes peace. He therefore caſts about how to lay a more ſolid Foundation for his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and at all turns calling to mind the Rules of his Tutor the Monk, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives how to involve the Intereſt of ſuch who had or ſhould own him, with his own. He was now in a Country that profeſſed the Roman faith; he conſidered that his Aids muſt be procured from thoſe of the ſame Belief; and obſerving the zeal of the Jeſuites in the propagating of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and that they had an influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Counſels of moſt Chriſtian Princes, he fixed upon them, as the firſt Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to his new Fabrick. They, who were not without their deſignes neither, had eaſie acceſs into his preſence; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all opportunities to feel his Pulſe, they were not wanting to let fall their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon the fortune of him and his Family, as labouring under the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and the Wrath of Chriſt, in refuſing Obedience to his Vicar the Pope; not failing to urge the ſuitableneſs of the puniſhment, which rendered the hand of God the more viſible: that that Prince who in oppoſition to the Catholick
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93173:21"/>Church had owned a Heterodox Patriarch, renouncing the Supremacy of the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chair, ſhould have the Throne of his Fathers poſſeſſed by an Uſurper. Our <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſeeming to be ſtaggered by theſe and the like arguments, did with equal art ſuffer himſelf to be convinced, but Gradually, and upon the Impulſes of Conſcience, leſt he might be thought to have a more faint Zeal to the truth of Religion, than to the recovery of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. He therefore makes his doubts and ſcruples upon the accompt of that, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives their ſolutions with ſo ſeeming an Innocence and Simplicity, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to themſelves a Conqueſt of his heart as well as of his head. He failed not to hint the reaſons of State which would oblige him to profeſs the Religion of his Fathers; and that to own any other, were to make a general War upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his whole people, who upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of himſelf to be given over to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would make it matter of Conſcience to reſiſt him as the publike Enemy to their faith: That what the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper wanted in the juſtneſs of his Title, would be ſupplied by the aſſerting the faith of <hi>Muskovy,</hi> and by the Influence
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93173:21"/>of the Patriarch, whoſe Dominion over the Conſcience of the <hi>Muskovites</hi> was the more abſolute, by how much they were the more ignorant in the knowledge of the beſt things; the common people being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſwayed by a blind devotion, which derived to them from their Anceſtors, they could better defend by Arms than Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. However, he let fall ſome profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which coming from him by ſnatches, ſeemed therefore the more real, that no Reaſons of State or Intereſts ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him againſt the convictions of his Conſcience, &amp; that he would not purchaſe the Univerſe with the wounding of that. Theſe ejaculations did yet more inflame theſe Apoſtles, and they were themſelves ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their own Artifice; concluding him real, while they were labouring to poſſeſs him that they were ſo; and reſolving, that he being once brought off from his former Tenets, they had gained a Champion to their Cauſe, whoſe ſoul was engaged in the Quarrel. Thus did our young States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lay his Foundation <hi>à Jove;</hi> but his affairs being of an active nature, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives how to fix to himſelf an Intereſt, which if things fell out well, might bear ſome proportion with the greatneſs of his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93173:22"/>pretenſions; if otherwiſe, might prepare him a retreat, where he might ſubſiſt in honour.</p>
            <p>The Palatine had a daughter young and ſprightly, of an Air Noble and Maſculine And though her Carriage was more char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming than her Complexion, and her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct parts leſs winning than the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; yet in her Entire, ſhe was very love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and taking. To all this, ſhe was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Courage above the ordinaries ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her Sex; and that ſo tempered and allay'd by a great meaſure of Underſtanding, that ſhe was conſidered at the rate of a ſecond <hi>Pallas:</hi> and all this attended with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſo Majeſtique, that her very aſpect rendered all her beholders her Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>

            <p>Whilſt he was entertaining himſelf with theſe thoughts, he was again viſited by the Jeſuites; whereof one, a very grave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to whom the reſt ſeemed to pay moſt reſpect, finding himſelf ſingly with the Prince, and both removed from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, (for they withdrew to a convenient diſtance) ſaid to him to this purpoſe: <hi>My Lord, had I not a very great aſſurance of your wiſdome and vertue, I ſhould not with ſo much paſſion offer my ſelf to the ſervice of your intereſts. Your temper hath ſo far prevailed upon me, that I must profeſs in my ſelf a natural propenſity to your ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the ſake of your perſon, which will be always dear to me. It is upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that I preſs thus (I must acknowledge with much indecencie) upon your retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Father,</hi> ſaid <hi>Demetrius, as I have ever had a high eſteem of your wiſdom and piety; ſo have I in my heart retained due acknowledgements of your zeal for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. My Lord,</hi> replyed the Jeſuite, <hi>being fully convinced of your Candour in rightly underſtanding my devotions for you, I ſhall uſe the more freedom towards
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93173:23"/>you. I have, according to the best of my underſtanding and obſervation, weighed every circumſtance of your Condition, with the preſent posture of your Affair; and I must needs ſay, that upon the whole matter I finde it full of intricacies and hazards. Your Adverſary is a perſon of great wiſdom, experience and courage, in poſſeſſion of a vast Empire, to which he is aſcended by many gradual Contrivances, that render him a States-man of no ordinary Indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. His Interests are laid deep in the Affections of the Nobilitie, most of whom he took care while the old Emperour lived to link to him by Preferments and Favours, and though ſome amongst them may malign his Precedencie and Election to the Throne yet we are reaſonably to ſuppoſe, that all Places of Trust and Power are in the hands of his Dependants and Favourites. You cannot be ignorant how he endeavours to ſtain your Pretenſions and Titles with the Ignominy of Imposture; which he hath ſpread abroad with much Artifice; making the Story ſo particular, that it carries with it the greater face of truth, as that which becauſe all men have power to examine, they therefore admit, without examination. To all this, adde how you are but lately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93173:23"/>to the World; and that in your diſcovery, you have not been ſo happie as to produce any other Testimony of your Quality beſides your own. And though there needs no more to conclude you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Emperours, than to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your face, where Majestie ſits enthroned as in its proper ſeat; yet you must confeſs with me, that this Evidence is too delicate for the groſſer multitude, who believe all things and nothing much alike. Let me therefore, who have ſtudied your Concerns, and am not a ſtranger to the Conſtitution of your Empire, preſume to offer you my humble and faithful Advice, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my true love to your Cauſe, and upon my great experience of the Affairs of this World, and the preſent posture of this Kingdom in which you now receive ſhelter. You must in the firſt place know, that there is not now living a more ambitious perſon than the Palatine; and could you ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend below your ſelf, as to make an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him, it would put ſo great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance upon your Cauſe, that I know no one thing in the world would more contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the ſucceſs of it. He is conſidered as a perſon of great wiſdom, and that he would not cast away his daughter upon an
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93173:24"/>Impostor; and whatever may be ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to your diſreputation, would loſe much of its credit, when the World ſhould ſee that he, in a flouriſhing condition, ſhould give away his only Daughter, a perſon of high Accompliſhments, and of an Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious extraction, into your arms. As for the change of your Religion, wherein I most magnifie your piety, and ſhall always offer up to the Father of Mercy my poor Prayers and thanks for touching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming your Princely heart with the love of the truth: Let me be free with you, and tell you, that that Point is to be handled with much caution: though it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to perſwade our Holy Father the Pope of your reality, yet it will be as requiſite to ſuppreſs all breathings of it in your own Territories; and 'tis therefore that I the more earneſtly adviſe this Alliance, which as it will draw the King of</hi> Poland <hi>to your Aid, ſo it will ſatisfie the ſcruples of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and People of</hi> Muſkovy, <hi>that what the Palatine does for you by himſelf and his Confederates, is for his own Child alſo. And now that I have given you the best counſel I am capable of offering to ſo High and Wiſe a Prince, I humbly ſupplicate your pardon, if in the freedom of it I have let
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93173:24"/>fall any expreſſion unworthy of your Sacred ears.</hi> Having ſpoke this, he was ſilent. Whereupon <hi>Demetrius</hi> approaching him neerer, takes him in his arms, and imbracing him with all imaginable affection, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I receive your counſel as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an Oracle, and I ſhall purſue it, as that upon which will depend my future happineſs; I only beg, that as you have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the main, you will contribute your particular Aids, and inſtruct me as well in the method as the thing. My Lord,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jeſuite, <hi>ſince you are pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my true meaning with ſo great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I ſhall not decline your ſervice in any circumſtance: Make your addreſſes to the young Lady; and when you have taſted her inclination, my advice is, that you move her Father for his Conſent. I ſhall be conſulted by him in the Affair, and you need not doubt of my Fidelity to your Interests, only it may be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for you to communicate to me the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of your applications, whereby I may the better contrive my ſelf for your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Demetrius</hi> promiſed to purſue his inſtructions; and it now being grown late, he diſmiſſed the Father with a very great Senſibility of his zeal and ſervices. He
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93173:25"/>being gone, <hi>Demetrius</hi> indulged the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his fortunes, and was over-joyed to think how powerful an Advocate he had gotten. He was not without reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the reality of his own Birth, and conſidered that by the ſame Rules he had deceived this quick-ey'd Juſuite, he might much more captivate the ſight and ſence of the thick-ſighted Multitude. For Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he knew that his heart had little of that to ſway it, only he ſaw the pretence was neceſſary. He conſidered it as a good ſtep to aſcend to a Throne by, and that if he could by pretending to that, raiſe himſelf to the poſſeſſion of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, he concluded his Title would then be cleer enough: in the mean time he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to purſue his deſignes, though he dyed in the attempt; and one day taking an opportunity to ſpeak to the Palatine, unboſomed himſelf to him with ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of love for his Daughter, that he ſeemed to prefer his acquiſition of her, to that of his Empire. The Palatine very ſenſible of the honour of this Alliance, and too wiſe not to venture upon ſuch ſair hopes, being alſo prepared by the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, is ſaid to have anſwered him after this manner.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:93173:25"/>
            <p>
               <q>My Lord, though what you are pleaſed to propoſe to me, be a matter of conſequence, not to be determined upon ſingle Counſels, yet your perſon hath ſomething of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick in it, that hurries me by ſecret im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſions to your ſervice and intereſts, which leave me no room to conſider, but how far I may contribute to thoſe ends. That noble Teſtimony you gave me of an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for my Daughter, hath gained ſo much credit with me, that I make not the least doubt of it; and in that moment you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned it to me, I must ſay, you ſpoke the deſires and ambition of my ſoul: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cleared that to you, which you are pleaſed to place in the first rank, let me oblige you to take my advice in the conduct of your other affairs, which in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are more conſiderable. You have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you an undertaking which will require all your powers and faculties for the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual proſecutions of it; you have upon you the eyes of the whole Chriſtian World; you have a potent Enemy ſeated upon your Throne, who hath all his Engines at work for your confuſion. The reputation of your Courage, your diſcretion, and indeed the reality of your being the true <hi>Demetrius,</hi> are all at ſtake, and must be vindicated by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93173:26"/>an induſtry worthy of you; elſe, let me take the freedom to tell you, you are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of <hi>Marina,</hi> were ſhe meaner than ſhe is. Then as to the ſeaſonableneſs of what you pleaſe to urge concerning her; I must with the ſame freedom tell you, that conſidering the Aids you depend upon, you ought not to think of marrying in this Juncture. King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> hath declared himſelf for your ſupply, with both men and money; and who knows but that the part he may pretend in your diſpoſal, may render him more zealous for you? Others, while you are ſingle, will run in to your aſſiſtance, every man forming to himſelf his hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations according to the condition of his Affairs; which you muſt nouriſh by thoſe ways and arts which may increaſe, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh your Confederates. I know I run a great riſque in this advice: It may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly fall out, that when you are aſcended up to your Throne upon the necks of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſhall be ſeated there Triumphant in their confuſions, that your Appetite may change; <hi>Marina</hi> may be ugly in your eye, or mean in your eſteem; and then all thoſe obliging promiſes will be forgot: But le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that, or worſe (if it may be) be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this delay, I cannot allow my
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93173:26"/>ſelf otherwiſe to adviſe you than I do. And to confirm to you that my Counſel reſpects you, not my ſelf, and that it is built upon Foundations of Honour and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I doe here promiſe you that I will Raiſe all the power I am able, and march in perſon with it, for the recovery of your Kingdom. I will eſpouſe your Intereſts with the ſame fervour as if they were my own; and will dye in the attempt, or will cut out a paſſage for you to your Dominions through the heart of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper. After this profeſſion of mine, let me have no more doubtings to remain in you, but cheer up, and intend the proſecution of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. Conceal and ſmother your paſſions for <hi>Marina,</hi> and let the Courage which is in your Soul ſhine in your eyes: It will like fire kindle a flame in others, which being cheriſhed as it ought, will ſtrengthen your hands, and multiply your numbers. I will not permit you to object any thing to this; I know 'tis the best way for you. I will ſo far pretend to the power of a Father (ſince you give me the honour to expect it) as to impoſe upon you in this affair.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus did the wiſe Palatine play with the temper of this young Gallant, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in hand with hopes, grounded
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93173:27"/>upon arguments and probabilities, which he could neither contradict, nor in his judgment diſapprove of. <hi>Demetrius</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pleaſed with the obligingneſs of theſe promiſes, yet ſeemed afflicted at the delay impoſed upon him; but ſeeing no other remedy, and that the enjoyment of his Miſtriſs depended upon his Eſtabliſhment in his Throne, he ſeemed to deſire this but as relative to the other: and now, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked out of an amourous lethargy, he beſtirred himſelf with more fervour than before. And reviving his conſiderations as to that part of his buſineſs which he would have to be acted by the Jeſuites, he admitted them more frequently into his preſence, not only declaring his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to their Religion, but promiſing to reduce <hi>Muskovy</hi> under the obedience of the Pope; and to make that proviſion for the Clergy, in Colledges, Monaſteries, and other Indowments, that the whole World ſhould be convinced of his entire Submiſſion to the Apoſtolique Sea. He was grown ſo exact a States-man, as to diſcern that the deſignes of Empire are no way more properly carried on, than under the Veil of Religion, where the parties to be managed may find their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93173:27"/>as well in point of Intereſt as Conſcience. The Fathers over-joyed with the hopes of ſo fair an acceſſion to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, promiſe Mountains, and aſſure him they will embark all the Princes of the Chriſtian World in the Quarrel. Neither were theſe induſtrious undertakers any way remiſs in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Intereſts were now become theirs, and a <hi>Croyſado</hi> was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on, to put more countenance on the holineſs of them: To this end, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Pope with the deſigne, Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Holineſs to eſpouſe it as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the Church, and accordingly to order powerful ſupplies of his own, beſides vigorous Recommendations to the King and Nobility of <hi>Poland,</hi> as neareſt hand. <hi>Demetrius</hi> alſo writ his Letters in reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able good Latine, which he had learned in his Cloyſter, and with his own hand, to the then Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth, in the Stile of Emperour of <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> wherein beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his own unhappineſs, he beſought the Aid, Prayers and Counſels of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, againſt the uſurpations of <hi>Boris;</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing that if it pleaſed God to reſtore him to his Crowns, he would not onely bring in his erring Inheritance into the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93173:28"/>Communion of the Mother-Church, but by a perfect Obedience to his Holineſs, as the Head of the ſame, ſignalize his gratitude to all Poſterity.</p>
            <p>He continued all this while at <hi>Sando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miria,</hi> and had not yet been preſented to the King; which he ſeemed paſſionately to deſire, hoping by the advantage of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal enterview, and the telling of his own ſtory, to gain upon the inclination of that mild Prince: and indeed he was not miſtaken in his computation; for being after ſome time introduced into the Kings preſence by the mediation of the two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latines of <hi>Sandomiria</hi> and <hi>Wiſnioweski,</hi> and received with Complements ſuitable to the Quality he bore, he made an han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Narrative of his Fortunes, in a Stile not inferiour to the Majeſty of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and yet obliging, and full of defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the King; in the cloſe whereof he took the freedom to mind him, that he himſelf came into the World a Son of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, being born in the noyſomeneſs of a Priſon, and was at laſt by various Fortunes conducted to a Crown: That therefore he would pleaſe to reflect upon the muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of humane affairs, and upon the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of an injured Prince, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93173:28"/>depended upon his Aids; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he would perform a double Act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; to chaſtiſe the Uſurper, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the rightful Heir upon the Throne of his Fathers. The King received his Addreſs with much reſpect and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and being inſtructed by his own former hardſhips to ſympathize with thoſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he gave him permiſſion, or rather connivance to make his leavies of Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers within his Dominions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> having thus improved the Credit of his extraction by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> which gained him a reputation too in the eſteem of other Princes, failed not by the fame of his preparations to fill his own countries with irreſolutions; which being ſeconded by ſecret Emiſſaries imployed into thoſe parts, the people, whoſe nature is to affect novelty, did with greedineſs ſwallow thoſe ſeditious Pamphlets ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad by him againſt that bloody U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper. To all this he added the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of invitations to the people to depart from that hated Murtherer, leſt they ſhould be overwhelmed in the vengeance prepared by God for him; fortifying the whole by promiſes not only of indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93173:29"/>for what was paſt, but of rewards and honours to ſuch as by their example ſhould inſtruct others to the duty of their obedience. Having thus plained his way by infecting the minds of his Countrymen, and corrupting ſome perſon of Eminencie of <hi>Muskovy,</hi> he judged it ſeaſonable to gratifie their expectation by rendering himſelf upon the Stage of Action, whereby not onely to give life, but ſecurity to his party; whoſe correſpondencie might be diſcovered to their Ruine: He therefore treated more particularly with the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, deſcending to Articles, the ſubſtance whereof were: That in conſideration of his Supplies and Aids, <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſhould upon the regaining of his Crown, repay him his full charges, Marry the Lady <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi> and introduce the Roman faith into his Dominions.</p>
            <p>Theſe Articles being Signed and Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, (though kept ſecret) the Palatine applied himſelf vigourouſly to the work, raiſed an Army, being under-hand ſupplied by the King: But Duke <hi>Conſtantine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioweski</hi> did publikely own the Quarrel, by whoſe example many prime men of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> preſented themſelves unto him upon the Borders, in the head of conſiderable
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93173:29"/>Troops raiſed at their own charges. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus ſtrengthened by freſh ſupplies, which ſignified more in their reputation than in their numbers, the Palatine, with <hi>Demetrius</hi> in his company, marched with his Army into <hi>Muskovy,</hi> the Winter being far advanced, ſending before him the terror of his Arms, and filled with hopes of Conqueſt. This Engagement was the Fountain from whence did ſpring thoſe many changes which we have ſince ſeen in that Empire, and may poſſibly be the effect of that Blazing-Star which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the 3 of <hi>October,</hi> 1614. in the 7th degree of <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> portending peradventure thoſe more than Civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords which tore and diſtracted the States of <hi>Muskovy</hi> and <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> had no ſooner entred into <hi>Muskovy,</hi> but that 8000 <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> diſpoſed to it by the perſwaſions of the crafty Monk, Ranked themſelves under his Colours: and being ſtrengthened with this conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſupply, they paſſed the River <hi>Bori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> at <hi>Kiow,</hi> without oppoſition, and ſate down with their whole Army before the walls of <hi>Eeringow.</hi> The place ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred upon ſummons, the Governour <hi>Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menno</hi> having taken this opportunity to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93173:30"/>revenge ſome diſgraces formerly placed upon him by <hi>Boris</hi> the Emperour. <hi>Putti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wol,</hi> a great and populous City, followed the example of <hi>Eeringow,</hi> induced to it by the <hi>Volgodenſian Coſſacks</hi> there in Garriſon, whoſe Governour <hi>Michaelowitz Solte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kowski</hi> was ſwayed by the temptations of <hi>Corelos</hi> General of the <hi>Demetrian Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,</hi> and who had the reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his own Troops of being ſkilled in the art Magick. Some other places, but of leſs importance, followed theſe Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the riſing Sun of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his hope ſhining ſtrong in their eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Boris</hi> received the tidings of theſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes with Aſtoniſhment: he vowed vengeance againſt theſe Revolters, after ſuch a manner, that the whole World ſhould dread the like Infidelity and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. In the mean time he prepares to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Invaſion with a force proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and having drawn together an Army of 100000 brave and choyce Souldiers he placed <hi>Fedw</hi> in the head of them a their General, commanding him to march with all ſpeed to the relief of <hi>Novogrod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> ſtraightly beleaguered by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> but as courageouſly defended by the Valour of <hi>Boſmanno</hi> the Governour. <hi>Boris</hi> in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93173:30"/>the mean time was not wanting to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in contriving what was moſt ſuitable to the preſent occaſions: and conſidering that thoſe of his Subjects who had run into <hi>Demetrius</hi> upon no provocation but that of Novelty, would, when their Appetite was ſerved, be as apt to repent and come back; He prepared Declarations of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity to publiſh amongſt them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, he diſpatched ſeveral Agents into <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lituania,</hi> to undeceive ſuch as ſeemed enclined to the Aids of an Heretick and Impoſtor; and having found out one <hi>Smyrna Otropeia</hi> Unkle to <hi>Hris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko,</hi> he directed him to repair to his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and to convince his adherents of the fallacie he had put upon them. But the Palatine, who was too far advanced to look back, would not permit <hi>Otropeia</hi> to come into his preſence, ſeeming to deſpiſe thoſe Artifices, as weak ſhifts to a declining Cauſe, and that he doubted not but he was prepared by the Uſurper, to lay a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh upon the Title of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for his Nephew. But thoſe Arts were too feeble to divert them from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting a ſevere account from him for his murther of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and placing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Throne of <hi>Demetrius</hi> the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93173:31"/>preſent Emperour. <hi>Boris</hi> finding no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs from theſe kind of little attempts, as it were from behind the Curtain, reſolved upon the diſpatch of a ſolemn Embaſſy to the King and Commonwealth of <hi>Poland,</hi> in order to expoſtulate with them the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Invaſion. The Embaſſador be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived at the Court of King <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and preſſing for a ſpeedy audience, it was granted him: he complained highly againſt the violation of the Truce lately confirmed between both Nations for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, by this unexpected Invaſion of his Dominions, ſacking his Towns, and killing his Subjects; and all upon no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or ſo much as the pretence of any. He added, that his Maſter hoped the King and Commonwealth of <hi>Poland</hi> would not only be more juſt, but better adviſed too, than lay themſelves under the reproach of perjury, by imbroyling them and their Allies in a new War, by violating a League ſworn to by them with all the Solemnities in the World: He therefore propoſed they would not only recal their Troops out of his Maſters Country, but that Commiſſioners might be appointed to conſider of the damages ſuſtained from them; and that that Impoſtor might be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93173:31"/>forthwith delivered into the Great Duke his Maſters hands, whom he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſk, and render him to the World in his native Complexion, a mean Creature, ſet up by the Malice of a diſcontented Prieſt. And then concluded, that in caſe the King and Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> ſhall decline thoſe equitable demands, they would create to them an Enemy, one of the greateſt Princes of the World. And thus having ſprinkled his deſires with a mixture of ſome Threats, he added Rich Preſents, which were diſtributed amongſt the Miniſters of State, and indeed moſt of thoſe in Credit about the King, with an open hand; ſo that there were very few but taſted of <hi>Muskovitiſh</hi> Bounty. But all this ſtate and charge amounted to nothing; the Intereſt of the Jeſuites ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Authority of the Pope, had rendered the King and his Council deaf to the applications of the Embaſſador. It was therefore reſolved that <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſhould be aſſiſted with freſh ſupplies, in order to his Reſtauration; which was conſidered as the only Baſis upon which to lay the Foundation of a perpetual League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Crowns, and the only means to root out that Schiſm in Religion, which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93173:32"/>hitherto had fomented their Quarrels; their affection being ſwayed by their faith.</p>
            <p>Theſe Reſolutions were kept ſecret, as the <hi>Arcana Imperii:</hi> for they did not judge it fit to come to an open Rupture, till they ſaw what was like to be the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Arms. Their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer therefore was, that the King and State of <hi>Poland</hi> knew nothing, at leaſt took no notice of what was done in <hi>Muskovy;</hi> and that thoſe Tumults raiſed by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> a <hi>Muskovian</hi> born, and Aided by <hi>Muskovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or any other Voluntiers engaged in his deſignes, did not at all infringe, or ſo much as trench upon the League, which they ſhould be always ready to obſerve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Crown and Empire. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador being diſmiſſed with this general Anſwer, without effecting what he came for; In the mean time the Armies in <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kovy</hi> were drawn within ſight of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, equal in hopes and deſires, though not in numbers. <hi>Demetrius</hi> upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies advance, raiſed his Siege; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving choſen his ground, with reſpect to the number of his men, wherein he was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to <hi>Boris,</hi> he was not without ſome hopes that ſome part of the Enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would, upon the cloſing, come over to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93173:32"/>him, having held an intelligence with ſome of their Officers to that purpoſe. But there appearing ſo formidable a power of the <hi>Muskovites,</hi> and but a handful of men with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> thoſe who had made him a promiſe of coming over to his ſide, judged it more adviſeable to adhere to their own. The Armies were now drawn ſo neer each other, that it was impoſſible to part without Engaging.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> therefore and the Palatine judging their ſafety depended upon their Courage, received the Enemies Charge, as men reſolved to conquer, or lie by it, not onely ſuſtaining, but reſiſting the fury of their Enemies. The Succeſs was a while diſputed with doubtful hopes, till at laſt, the Victory began to declare it ſelf for the more numerous Force, which powring in freſh ſupplies, the <hi>Polonian</hi> was forced to ſhrink under the impreſſions of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, after they had given teſtimonies of great reſolutions, having fought it out with ſo great a pertinacie, that the Victory coſt <hi>Boris</hi> the loſs of many of his men. His General received ſeveral wounds; and it was with much difficulty, that the Enemy quitted the ground: at laſt they were diſordered and broke, ſaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93173:33"/>by flight. <hi>Demetrius</hi> having rallied ſome few of his Troops, retreated to <hi>Ribſcum,</hi> and the Palatine returned into <hi>Poland</hi> to raiſe new Forces, having left 8000 of his men upon the place, with all his Cannon and Baggage. The tidings of this Victory was carried to <hi>Boris</hi> the Great Duke, by <hi>Boſmanno</hi> the Governour of <hi>Novogrod,</hi> whom <hi>Boris</hi> received as his better Angel; and (the General having rendered him with an advantagious chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter) cauſed him to be preſented with a great Baſon of pure Gold, filled with Ducats of the ſame Mettal, and all the Officers of the Army with Medals, and increaſe of Pay.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Boriſians</hi> ſhewed more Courage in gaining this Victory, than Conduct in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it to their advantage, waſting their time at the Siege of <hi>Krom,</hi> whilſt the Enemy had room without interruption to gather together their ſcattered Troops; who had they been chaſed while their fears had been upon them, muſt neceſſarily have fallen into the hands of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and then the Garriſons had followed their Fate. But the Great Dukes Army being fate down b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>re <hi>Krom,</hi> the place was defended againſe them with ſo great
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93173:33"/>a Courage, that they deſpaired of taking it: whereupon the greater part of the Army being reinforced with freſh men, marched towards <hi>Ribſcum,</hi> in order to the ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Forces, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of his Levies.</p>
            <p>He upon this defeat found the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe friends which had been made with his Succeſſes, not himſelf. Many who had run in upon the fame of his proſperous March, ran now from him, as from a falling houſe, that would in its own ruine involve thoſe within it: Yet was not he wanting to himſelf, having his Courage cheriſhed by two <hi>Ciſtercian</hi> Monks and two Jeſuites, who attended him, eſpecially the latter, in all his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Theſe inflame him to a perſeverance, with promiſes that the Iſſue would be Crowned with Succeſs to him, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his Enemies. In the mean time the <hi>Boriſians</hi> advanced towards him, upon intelligence whereof he ſent out his Horſe to face them, while he was drawing up his Foot. Who had ſeen the great diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between both Armies, the one of a vaſt Body of Horſe and Foot fleſhed with Victory, a great Train of Artillery &amp; Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; the other not exceeding 5000 ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93173:34"/>men; thoſe abounding with wants, moſt of them Raw and Undiſciplined; and the reſt, the remnant of a defeated Army, might reaſonably have gueſſed at the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. But the power of Fortune, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Providence, in this juncture, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared beyond humane expectation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> was in a ſtrange Country, no Counſel about him, unknowing in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, prepoſterous in his Orders, and not ſo much as a temptation left him to hope: his Horſe being advanced, were oppoſed by thoſe of the Enemy, of whom upon the Charge they killed about 1000; which diſcouraging the reſt, they ſhrink, and being preſſed on by the <hi>Demetrians,</hi> had not time to rally, but were in diſorder for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon their own Foot, breaking their Ranks, and doing for <hi>Demetrius</hi> what his Army could never have effected. He purſuing his Succeſs, had the ſlaughter of that great Body, which not being able to make Head, were cut down without any reſiſtance. And thus what began but in a light Skirmiſh, ended in an intire Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Demetrians</hi> laden with ſpoils, (the whole Camp and Train falling into their hands) returned in Triumph to <hi>Puttiwol,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:93173:34"/>where the Fame of this ſignal Victory ſpreading it ſelf to their advantage, Five good Towns with their Forts rendered him their Submiſſions; whereby he was furniſht with Ammunition, and all other proviſions for War. A while after, two other places, <hi>Jalka</hi> and <hi>Leptina,</hi> rendered themſelves; and the great Province of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neria</hi> made one entire preſent of all tis ſtrengths at once. Others alſo haſting in to be firſt, or with the firſt acknowledge the Conquerour, who received their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes with great moderation upon ſo unexpected a Succeſs. His great care was the relieving of <hi>Krom,</hi> beſieged by the reſt of the Enemies Army: but having by a Spy which came from out the Town, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the place was in no danger, and that it might defend it ſelf for ſome longer time againſt the Aſſailants; He diverted his thoughts from relieving it, till he had improved his late Victory by enlarging his Quarters. He continued at <hi>Puttiwol,</hi> to reinforce his ſtrengths, and to receive the Submiſſions of ſeveral places and perſons, which daily rendred themſelves with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits to his ſmall Army. While he was thus buſied, <hi>Boris</hi> was not leſs active in his Levies, repairing the Breaches in his ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:93173:35"/>Regiments, and doing what ever elſe might be needful to oppoſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of a great Enemy. He had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his Emiſſaries and Agitatours in the Army of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who endeavoured to debauch the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and ſuch other of the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> as had liſted themſelves in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, tempting them by exceſſive rewards and honours to ſeize upon the Impoſtor, (as they Stiled him) and to preſent him to the Emperour, as a Peace-offering for their Rebellion. And to inforce this the better, they had with them a thundering Mandate from the Patriarch, as the Vicar of Chriſt, and Head of the true Church. Theſe Arguments ſwayed little, ſpecially thoſe grounded upon point of Conſcience: The people had ſhook hands with that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, only they kept ſo much of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of it, as might ſerve to juſtifie their preſent ſwerving from the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some of theſe Agents were ſeized upon, and being expoſed to the Rack, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the whole deſigne upon the perſon of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who being to gain upon the affections of the people by his clemencie, diſmiſſed them; deſpiſing, out of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous careleſneſs of his own particular, to revenge his own injury upon ſo ignoble
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93173:35"/>Inſtruments. He writ alſo his Letters to the Patriarch, to mind him of the duty of his Office; that he ſhould not fix the Seal of Religion, to juſtifie an uſurpation founded upon murther and perfidy, but rather diſpoſe the people to yield to the Son of <hi>John Baſilius</hi> their undoubted So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign that Obedience and Submiſſion which was due to him from them by the Laws of God and the Empire. 'Tis ſaid, he alſo ſent a Meſſage to <hi>Boris,</hi> adviſing him from thoſe ungenerous practiſes of Aſſaſſinations and Libels; and that if he would give teſtimony of his repentance, by renouncing the unjuſt poſſeſſion of the Throne, to which he had aſcended by a continued Series of unworthy and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked practices, He ſhould be permitted to retire into what part of the Empire he pleaſed, with an entire indemnity for what was paſt, and all reaſonable caution and ſecurity for his future ſafety. But the Great Duke refuſed theſe overtures with ſcorn and indignation; and caſting about how he might root out this growing evil, he judged it adviſable to frame a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon his forein ſupplies: wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that if he could prevent thoſe, the Rebellion in his own Kingdom would
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93173:36"/>in time, extinguiſh for want of fuel to ſuſtain it; and that thoſe of his Subjects who were deaf to his invitations, during the proſperity of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> whilſt he was owned and aſſerted by forain Princes, would when he were left to his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, fall from him with no leſs fervor than they had run in to him. In order to this, he treats with the <hi>Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Swediſh</hi> Embaſſadors then in his Court, by what means King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> might be beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated in his own Dominions. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes were accordingly laid to imbroy him at his own doors, and to kindle a fire in <hi>Poland,</hi> which might oblige him to call home his own Subjects for the quenchin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of it. But amidſt all his contrivance of State, formed with prudence agreeable to the occaſion, he was ſeized with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tearing in his Bowels, a deluge of Blood flowing out of his Mouth, Ears and Noſtrils; with which, after ſome moments his enraged Soul iſſued out, leaving the Body a horrid Spectacle to all about him and a Monument of the inſtability of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane greatneſs. Some ſay he died of an Apoplexie, others, (the fancied Fate of moſt Princes) that he was poyſoned; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> having by a more delicate contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93173:36"/>ſubdued him at his own Weapon. However it was, he expired in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1605. having lived Emperour the ſpace of ſeven years; during which time, his Government was adorned with all imaginable moderation and juſtice, as if to compenſate the people for the murther of his Prince, and to make good the ſufficiencie of their choyce in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for adminiſtration: And if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him who writ his Panegyrick, he is to be juſtly reckoned amongſt the beſt of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Dukes.</p>

            <p>THe Great Duke being thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſnatcht away in the midſt of all his deſignes, and in the ſtrength of his Age, the Nobility and chief Officers of the Army were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93173:37"/>with the ſurpriſe of it; and many of them (for it is a ſuperſtitious Nation) reflecting upon this extraordinary adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a clear deciſion of Providence, with relation to the right of <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> began to entertain inclinations in his favour: and certainly had not the people interpoſed, they would have manifeſted the ſame by declaring him the Son of <hi>John Baſilius.</hi> But the people being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd with the Death of <hi>Boris,</hi> came to Court in ſwarms, and in a Tumultuary way (as if prompted by ſome irreſiſtible impulſe) they placed his Son <hi>Fedro</hi> upon the Throne of his Father, declaring his Mother <hi>Regent</hi> in his minority; and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all before them like a torrent, they ſorced all the Nobility to ſwear Fealty to them, and to ratifie the election by an Act of State, grounded upon a mixture of deſcent, and the ſuffrage of the people. The Army, as if ſwayed by the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, did by their example ſalute him Emperour, and by their Deputies thereto appointed, ſent him a Declaration, wherein they promiſed to adhere to him with the expoſing of their lives and fortunes, and to ſtand by him, not only in repelling the common Enemy, but alſo in ſuppreſſing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93173:38"/>the Rebellion raiſed by his own Subjects The State of Affairs being thus eſtabliſhed at Court, care was had for the interment of the deceaſed Duke, whoſe Corps was without much ſolemnity laid in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of their Princes. After this, a Council was held, for the more effectual proſecuting of the War. <hi>Peter Boſmanno,</hi> upon the accompt of his great ſervice and known abilities, was appointed Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Army, and diſpatched to the Camp before <hi>Krom; Miſlikowski</hi> and <hi>Zwiski</hi> being recalled to aſſiſt the Regent and the young Emperour in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Government. <hi>Krom</hi> had been aſſaulted by the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> ten ſevera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93173:38"/>hath recourſe to policie; and framing a Letter to the Governour, told him he was advanced ſo far, as a Forlorn to the main Army, and to keep the Leaguer from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the Country, while the <hi>Poliſh</hi> and <hi>Coſſack</hi> Auxiliaries were coming up to their relief, under the conduct of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> in perſon: And then magnifying their fidelity, and abounding in promiſes of rewards and honours to them, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with an aſſurance of ſpeedy relief. This Letter was put into the hands of a bold fellow, who undertook the delivery of it, but was by the crafty Commander directed ſuch ways towards the Town, as led him directly upon an Out-guard of the Enemies, who having ſeized upon him, brought him to the Head-quarters, where being preſented to the Rack, he diſcovered his Letters; and being examined, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the effects of them as a truth which he had heard diſcourſed of by the chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of <hi>Zaporius</hi> his Army. The Leaguer was as yet commanded by <hi>Hoduinus</hi> a near Kinſman of the late Great Duke's; the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers of the Army diſdaining to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>Boſmanno,</hi> as a Son of Fortune. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this intelligence, there were 2000 Horſe commanded to keep the avenues of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93173:39"/>Town, while the reſt of the Army drew off to encounter the Enemy. <hi>Zaporius</hi> that he might better countenance his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement, drew out his whole Army in Battalia, and having at a further diſtance behind him placed all his Boyes and Bedles of the Army, with all the Carriages and ſome few Souldiers to make up a Front, which he extended to a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; He with his real Forces marched up to encounter the Enemy, having given order to this mock-Army that was behind, and which he had furniſhed with Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, Drums and Colours, that upon the Engagement they ſhould advance in view and fill the Air with ſhouts and noiſes that the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were at hand The Fight was fierce, and doubtful in the beginning; and <hi>Zaporius</hi> was ſo hard put to it by the greater numbers of the Enemy, that notwithſtanding all his ſkill, he muſt have ſunk under their weight, had not <hi>Boſmanno</hi> (diſobliged by his own Party) who had the command of ſome Reſerves, inſtead of charging the Enemy, joyned his Troops to theirs; and then in the head of his men declared that <hi>Demetrius</hi> was the true Emperour, inviting all who had a zeal to the honour of their Country, to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93173:39"/>follow his example in adhering to the rightful Prince. This extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture did equally ſurprize both Armies, poſſeſſing the one with a conſternation, and the other with amazement; in ſo much, that the Fight held up as by joynt conſent, and both ſides ſeemed to expect the determination of the Cauſe, by ſome other Umpirage than that of their Swords. <hi>Boſmanno</hi> taking advantage of this profound Silence, ſhews himſelf again betwixt both Armies; and crying out with a loud Voice, invited all thoſe who had any reverence for the Aſhes of <hi>John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius,</hi> or honour for his Son, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the publike peace, that they ſhould follow his example by rendring themſelves to the obedience of their rightful Prince, where they ſhould be ſure of Indemnity and Protection. <hi>Boſmanno</hi> being of great reputation with the common Souldiers, as one that had engaged with them in many Services, had the fortune in this juncture to make ſo ſtrange an impreſſion upon their minds by his diſcourſe, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome murmur amongſt themſelves, they all cried out with a loud voice, that they would live and dye with <hi>Boſmanno.</hi> The Nobility obſerving the courſe of the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93173:40"/>ſtream, and leſt that they might be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in reſiſting of it, reſolved to follow the Current; and immediately decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for <hi>Demetrius,</hi> diſpatched a Party of 500 to him to <hi>Puttiwol,</hi> with tender of their Submiſſions, &amp; ſupplicating his pardon for their former defections, whereto they had been inſnared by the Artifices of <hi>Boris.</hi> They further offered him an entire Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of themſelves, and of the ſtrength of the Empire; beſeeching him he would come over to them, that they might march under his Conduct to the Poſſeſſion of his Hereditary rights. <hi>Hodwenus</hi> having thus loſt his Army, which deſerted him as one man, purpoſed to ſave himſelf by flight; but being purſued by a Party thereto imployed, was ſeized upon, and preſented to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> in whoſe preſence he diſdaining to bow, or pay thoſe reſpects due to an Emperour, was commanded to Priſon, and to be laden with Irons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> tranſported with this happy news, broke up with thoſe Troops which he had about him, marching directly to <hi>Krom,</hi> where he careſſed the Governor and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with all kindneſs imaginable, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying their Courage and Fidelity, and heaping upon them promiſes of Mountains,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93173:40"/>when he ſhould be eſtabliſht in his Throne. From thence he went to <hi>Arol,</hi> where the revolted Lords and Army at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his coming, and received him with all the Submiſſions and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of joy that could be expreſſed: And being by this acceſſion of Force ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred abſolute Maſter of the Field, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by eaſie marches toward <hi>Musko</hi> the Seat of the Empire; and being come as far as <hi>Tula,</hi> he made ſome ſtay there, as well to refreſh his Army, as to conſider how to carry on the reſt of his Affairs: And having adviſed with his Council, he writ his Letters to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Musko,</hi> to acquaint them that God had in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner owned him and his Cauſe, by bringing over the Army that oppoſed him to their due obedience without bloodſhed, much to his ſatisfaction, rather to have them reduced by the convictions of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, than by the force of his Arms: he therefore invited them, according to that pious example of the Army, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their obedience; and as a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of it, to root out from the face of the earth that hated Progeny of <hi>Boris,</hi> who had murthered his elder Brother, and had laid Trains for his life, but that he was
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93173:41"/>reſcued from them by deliverances not much ſhort of miracle. That for his part he had a heart to forgive all their former failings and rebellions, and as a true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Country, to extend his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie to ſuch as ſhould manifeſt their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence: But if after this advice, and the example of their fellow-Subjects, they ſhould yet perſiſt in their rebellious actings they muſt expect he conſequence in the ruine of them and their City.</p>
            <p>Theſe Letters falling into the hands of ſome of <hi>Fedro</hi>'s Forces which he had drawn together for the defence of <hi>Musko,</hi> were ſuppreſſed, ſo that the people knew nothing of them. <hi>Demetrius</hi> in the mean time wondered he could receive no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his Letters, till at laſt gueſſing the truth of the matter as indeed it was, he employed ſome private Agents to <hi>Craſna Cella,</hi> a great Village within a quarter of a mile of the City, peopled with Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Handicrafts-men, whoſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding however was in the Town: He by theſe Agents inſinuated into them, that upon the ſingle deſire of their ſafety, he had imployed divers Meſſengers to the City with overtures of peace; but that not having anſwer, he was diſpoſed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93173:41"/>rather to believe that his Letters were ſuppreſſed by the <hi>Gedanow</hi>-Faction, than that the people were wanting to him in ſuitable returns. He had a conſiderable Army about him, ready upon their March, and impatient for want of action; but he had made that long halt at a convenient diſtance from ſo populous a City, rather than incommode it by a nearer approach: He therefore deſired to underſtand their inclinations, according to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to move; putting into their hands, whether they would embrace Peace under the auſpice of his Government, or the unhappy conſequence of a bloody War, for which themſelves ſhould ſtand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, and not he. The Inhabitants of <hi>Craſna Cella</hi> receive this Meſſage with great reverence; and the Agents having with them Copies of thoſe Letters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly writ to the Magiſtrates of the City, they delivered them likewiſe: whereupon the Inhabitants trooping together, took with them <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Meſſengers into the Town; and being come into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, they cauſed his Letters to be openly read to that world of people that flockt about them: whereupon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſhew of tumult (which was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93173:42"/>a wonder) they went as one man to the Palace of Duke <hi>Baſilius Zuiski,</hi> and by two of their number in a very civil manner beſeech him to tell them if young <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> the Son of <hi>John Baſilius</hi> had been ſlain at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gletz</hi> or not? <hi>Zuiski</hi> without the leaſt heſitation anſwered, that in very truth <hi>Demetrius,</hi> upon notice of <hi>Boris</hi> his deſigne had been ſecretly conveyed away, and another Youth of his years and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection, the Son of a Prieſt, put in his place in the Princes Bed, who according to the plot laid by <hi>Boris,</hi> was murthered and interr'd, as the right <hi>Demetrius,</hi> with the Funeral of Princes. To this he added that he was the real <hi>Demetrius</hi> who lay with his Army at <hi>Tula.</hi> The people hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this from ſo great and eminent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and conſidering how the bulk of the Nobility had declared for <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who was ready with a potent Army to advance towards them, moſt of the Provinces ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already tendred him their Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, judged it high time for them alſo to make their Addreſſes; and whilſt they were in conſultation of the affair, ſome Courtiers having had notice of the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, were come with ſome of the Guards to diſperſe them, and ſeize upon <hi>Demetrius</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:93173:42"/>his Agents; which the people not only oppoſed, but proceeding from one degree of heat to another, breathed nothing but <hi>Demetrius</hi> his pretenſions, aſſerting him to be the rightful Prince; and that they would not any longer be ſo far wanting to themſelves and the Empire, as to refuſe their obedience where by the Laws of God and the Land it was due: and then crying, <hi>Long live</hi> Demetrius, <hi>Great Duke and Emperour of</hi> Ruſſia; <hi>come,</hi> ſay they, <hi>let us go and deſtroy that Viperous brood of the</hi> Gedanowes <hi>from the face of the earth.</hi> This ſaid, they ran toward the Court like mad-men, and as a Snow-ball ſo encreaſed by rowling, that by the time they were come thither, their numbers were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to many thouſands, ſending their Clamours before them, which filled the Court with terrour and confuſion: All within and about it were ſacrificed to their rage and fury, and no life eſcaped them but that of the Great Duke, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs-Regent and her Daughter, who were rather reſerved for the judgment of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> and wherewith to purchaſe their own peace and pardon, than upon the accompt of tenderneſs towards that Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. She was a Lady of high ſpirit and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93173:43"/>courage, and conſidering that ſhe and her Children were reprived only to add to the Triumphs of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> reſolved to put them and her ſelf out of the malice of his power: in order whereto, ſhe prepared a ſtrong Poyſon, and diſpoſed them to pledge her in that Fatal mixture. Her Tears did eaſily deceive their Innocence; and yet theirs had almoſt overcome her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie: <hi>Come,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>the dear pledges of your Fathers love;</hi> and then taking them in her arms, <hi>Come,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>my joy and grief, it may be the Tyrant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rendered us uncapable of diſturbing his repoſe, will be content with our ſpoils, and ſpare our lives.</hi> Here ſhe pauſed; but ſuddenly recollecting her ſelf, <hi>No, no,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>Treaſon is never ſecure ſo long as there are any left to reproach its Author: Let us therefore not linger out a miſerable life by a more miſerable delay, till the Tyrant have ſtudied to deſtroy us more Exquiſitely, and more Ignominiouſly:</hi> and with this ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cup, ſhe haſtily ſwallowed the greateſt part of it, forcing her Children to take off the reſt; and then claſping them in her arms, the Poyſon did in a ſhort time ſpread its vigour over their tender Bodies, all of them expiring as by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93173:43"/>joynt conſent all together in their mutual embraces. Such as favour <hi>Demetrius,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the Princeſs was preſerved by his command, by the ſpeedy applying of Antidotes to ſubdue the malignity of the Poyſon. His Enemies alſo ſay the ſame; adding, he preſerved her but in order to ſatisfie his luſt. The people being inflamed with the heart of their own fury, after they had pillaged the whole Court, ran like mad men into the City, ſeized upon all the <hi>Boriſian</hi> Party and Family, putting many of them to death at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and the reſt they hurried into a Fort adjoyning to the City, where having ſtript them ſtark naked, they turned them in promiſcuouſly, men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren together, without either Cloaths, Food, or Covert; and ſome of them, by the coldneſs of the Air, and for want of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, periſhed; they ſtrangle the reſt, or put them to ſome other violent death, ſo that there was not one of the Family left alive; their rage herein executing upon the Houſe of <hi>Boris</hi> an exemplary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, proportionable to the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty wherewith he had treated that of his Maſter; God in his juſtice puniſhing his Cruelty to them with a due retaliation
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93173:44"/>of the like upon his Poſterity. We have in this a lively Deſcription of the peoples temper; unconſtant in their reſolution, violent in their love, and equally ſo in their hate: They in this juncture caſt off all their gratitude to the memory of <hi>Boris,</hi> their proſperity under his calm and wiſe Government, his impartial diſtribution of Juſtice, the many publike Buildings by him erected for the ſplendor and uſe of their City. They had no remembrance left of his great induſtry and charges in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Food for them in that more than <hi>Samaritan</hi> Famine, which happened in his Reign, in the years 1601, 1602, 1603. or finally, no reflection upon the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous peace and repoſe which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for them with their Neighbour-Princes. But though they might be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to bury the memory of thoſe things in the Grave of <hi>Boris,</hi> yet the wonder was that they ſhould ſo ſuddenly deſtroy their own Act, in deſtroying him whom they had placed upon the Throne but two months before, as a Soveraign of their own choyce, contrary to the deſigne of the Nobility, whom they forced to ſwear fealty to him, vowing to live and dye in the defence of him, his Mother and Siſter,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93173:44"/>now rendered the unhappy Objects of their boundleſs fury.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Boriſians</hi> being thus rooted out, wherein the Citizens were equally cruel and diligent; they diſpatched their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to render him their Submiſſions, and to aſſure him, that in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Letters, they had deſtroyed the Family of the <hi>Gedanowes</hi> to a man: That <hi>Fedro,</hi> his Mother and Siſter, were in ſafe cuſtody, in order to his Majeſties diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and that not only their gates, but their hearts were open too for his recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Demetrius</hi> upon this agreeable news advanced toward <hi>Musko</hi> with his whole Army: ſuch of the Lords as had not yet preſented themſelves to him, met him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way; and being come within a mile of the Town, their Magiſtrates were there in their Formalities, as a repreſentative of the City, with a tender of its Homage; which he received according to the mode of that Nation, in Bread and Salt. They had alſo prepared a vaſt Preſent for him in Gold and Jewels; which he received with a ſhow of kindneſs. And being now owned by all the Nobility and Orders of the Kingdom, and well aſſured of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the people to his Intereſt; he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93173:45"/>made his entrance into the Royal City in great State, upon the 20th of <hi>June,</hi> in the year 1605. Emperour and Great Duke of <hi>Muskovy,</hi> and many other Provinces, and King of <hi>Caſan</hi> and <hi>Aſtracan.</hi> The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this celebrious Cavalcade was thus: The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe with their Launces pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, had the Van: Some thouſands of <hi>Muskovites</hi> followed them in good order, having in the midſt of their Body, the Coach of <hi>Demetrius</hi> drawn by ſix beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Horſes, with all his lead Horſes nobly Sadled and Trapped, with embroidery of Gold and Jewels. After theſe came the Clergy, with ſquared Enſignes born before them, on which were Painted ſome Saint or other, as our <hi>Lady,</hi> St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> their <hi>Patron,</hi> and the like. The Patriarch brought up the Rear of theſe Spiritual Warriours; and at ſome diſtance behind him was <hi>Demetrius</hi> himſelf mounted upon a goodly Milk-white Courſer, environed on all ſides with the Lords and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that made up his Train. All the Bells rung for joy, and all the Streets, Windows, tops of Houſes, and all other eminent places ſwarmed with multitudes of people, who as he paſſed along, fell upon their faces, and then raiſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93173:45"/>up, cried as one man, <hi>Long live the Great Duke of</hi> Ruſſia; <hi>Thou art the right Sun and bright Morning-Star that now ſhines in</hi> Muſkovy. To which he replied, <hi>God give you my Subjects Health and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, ſtand up and pray for me.</hi> As he paſſed along, he was ſhewed the Palace of <hi>Boris;</hi> but he turned another way, as loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to behold that place where had been hatched all the Villanies againſt him and the Blood-Royal of <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> and declaring it his pleaſure to have it defaced, the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling people were not long in the execution of his Commands, laying thoſe goodly Fabricks in a moment level with the ground. <hi>Demetrius</hi> being entered the Palace-Royal, diſmiſſed the Princes and Lords, who trooped together into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, where <hi>Bogdan Bielski</hi> made them an Exhortation to acknowledge the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God for their Great Duke, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to be true and faithful to him: That he was the undoubted Son of <hi>John Baſilius:</hi> and thereupon taking his Croſs out of his Boſom with St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture upon it, he kiſſed it, and ſwore that their preſent Emperour was the right <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> and that to the day of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery he had been concealed and kept
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93173:46"/>in the Boſom of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who had now reſtored him to them for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them and their Land. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole people anſwered with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acclamations three times, <hi>God ſave our Great Duke, God give him health; God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh all his Enemies, and all thoſe that fail in their Fidelities to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> being by this extraordinary Concurrence of his Affairs got upon the Throne, aſſumed the manage of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into his own hands: and having made it his ſtudy to underſtand the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of his Crown, as it ſtood related to forain Princes upon the accompt of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick or any other conſiderations of State; he informed himſelf what Embaſſadors were then in the Kingdom, either at Court, or upon their return; he judged it advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable to ſignifie to them his happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And underſtanding that amongſt others of other Princes, that Mr. <hi>John Merrick</hi> Agent, and Sir. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> Embaſſadors for the King <hi>Great Britain,</hi> having received their Diſpatches from <hi>Boris,</hi> were upon their return homeward; in order whereunto, having finiſhed their other Negotiations, they were gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Sea-ſide; <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſent this

            <p>Theſe and ſome other publike affairs being diſpatched, <hi>Demetrius</hi> judged it very conducible to his eſtabliſhment, to have the Solemnities of his Coronation ſpeedily performed; the Celebration of which were therefore appointed to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon the Kalends of <hi>September:</hi> for 'tis then that the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> do, as the <hi>Jews</hi> of old did, begin their year. But <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> impatient of delay in that material Circumſtance, would have it done upon the 29th of <hi>July,</hi> after his enterance into <hi>Musko,</hi> upon which day he was by the Patriarch crowned with the Imperial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem of thoſe Kingdoms; after which he cauſed the Corps of <hi>Boris</hi> to be taken up out of that Sepulchre wherein he had been interred (being that belonging to the Royal Family) and buried without Solemnity, in a private Church-yard without the Town. Before the Coronation, 'twas judged ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable that the ſuppoſed Mother of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> who had for many years been ſhut up in a Monaſtery by <hi>Boris,</hi> ſhould be ſent for to Court, as a reputation to the Solemnity; which by <hi>Demetrius</hi> his art was improved to the utmoſt: for upon advertiſement of her being within a League of the Town, he went forth in Perſon to meet her; and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93173:49"/>being come within view of her Coach, he alighted from his horſe, and making his Addreſſes to her with all imaginable Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſhe received him with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of Affection: She would have come out of her Coach, but he would not permit it; neither could ſhe prevail with him to come up to her, proteſting that as ſhe had given him life, ſo would he pay it her back in his Obedience; that the Crown of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> was hers, and ſhould be only born by him, the better to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute her Orders. And with theſe and ſome other obliging entertainments of this kind, ſhe was conducted to the Palace; <hi>Demetrius</hi> following the Coach on foot, bare-headed, till the Empreſs ſtopping, declared that unleſs he would get up on horſe-back, ſhe would accompany him on foot. Being come to the Palace, ſhe was conducted into the uſual habitation of ſuch who were Widdows of the Royal Family; where being alighted, ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced <hi>Demetrius</hi> with great paſſion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him before all the Lords and Courtiers preſent, to be her Son, begot by Duke <hi>John Baſilius;</hi> evidencing the ſame by many particular marks and tokens, which gave great credit to the Impoſtor
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93173:49"/>(if it were one.) His ſtature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion had a reſemblance to that of the true <hi>Demetrius;</hi> his hair was black and hard like his, with a mark upon his noſe and the right hand as the Prince alſo had: And though the Lady might well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the features of her own <hi>Demetrius,</hi> whom ſhe had loſt but ſeven years before, and that this in reality was not he; yet ſhe wiſely diſſembled the matter, it being grown too far for her to contradict: and beſides that, ſhe lay under a double obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to him, having not only enjoyed her liberty, but the ſatisfaction of an entire Revenge by his means upon <hi>Boris</hi> and his Family. However it was, ſhe treated him with all the demonſtrations of a warm and ſincere Affection, while he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and reverenced her with a more ſhan filial Duty; ſo great a tenderneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in their careſſes, that their Tears of Joy were attended with a deluge from the eyes of the Lords and all others upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Common fame ſince his misfortune, ſeems to render him ſuch; and <hi>Petreius</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>Muskovy,</hi> hath a Jury of Arguments to confirm it.

And yet we have in our own Land had appeals to God upon the moſt palpable Rebellion that ever was committed againſt a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign; proceeding to that hight, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Anovnted of the Lord in the Name of the Lord. Poſſibly this <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> had it inſtilled into him by the Prieſt his Tutor, that he was in reality the Son of <hi>John Baſilius;</hi> but however it was, or whether he believed himſelf ſo or not, he was rendered to the world as the moſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93173:51"/>remarkable Object of Fortune that many Ages can parallel; ſhe in him paſſing to both extreams, by which may be obſerved the mutability of humane affairs, and that their change is natural.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> was ſcarce warm in his Seat, when the Lords either taking it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was an Impoſtor, or weary of that Inſtrument wherewith they had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves to revenge upon <hi>Boris</hi> and his Family the Cauſe of the Blood-Royal of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> began to form a Conſpiracie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his life; which being ſecured by his Guard of <hi>Poles</hi> and other Forreners, their firſt deſigne was to remove them, the better thereby to break in upon him. In order to this, they took all opportunities to breathe their Moans and Complaints to ſuch as they knew to be in favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him: That it was the anguiſh of their Souls, after the Teſtimony given by them of their Loyalty, to find their Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain doubtful thoughts concerning them; which they collected from his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Poles</hi> and other mercenary Strangers to guard his perſon, as if he could be more ſafe in their hands, than in thoſe of his native Subjects, who could do no leſs than conſider themſelves neglected, at
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93173:51"/>leaſt to ſee the Royal Perſon of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in the hands of ſtrangers, as if to defend him againſt his own Subjects: That it was a new thing in <hi>Muskovy</hi> to have a Life-guard of Forreners, and did more argue the fears of an Uſurper, than the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of a legitimate Prince; and that they ſhould underſtand theſe kinde of Guards, (were they not well aſſured of the Clemencie of their Great Duke) as Executioners of his diſpleaſure, when he ſhould pleaſe to look back into thoſe times when they had obeyed the commands of the Tyrant <hi>Boris.</hi> Thus did the Lords whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per their griefs, as they call'd them, but with ſo great modeſty, that <hi>Demetrius</hi> being acquainted with them, and with what tenderneſs and reſpect they were uttered, reſolved to comply entirely with them, and to give up himſelf abſolutely into the arms of his own people; being ſo ſtrangely deluded with this ſeeming kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he not only diſmiſſed his Guards, but his Auxiliaries beſides. The Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators having got over theſe great ſteps, drew more into their Party, whereby the Plot was rendered more publike, till at laſt it reacht the ears of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who too late repenting his unadviſed credulity,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93173:52"/>would yet make appear his reſentment of this Treaſon; and cauſing ſome to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, they were tortured till they confeſſed the whole deſigne, and that they had been induced to it by the inſinuations of <hi>Baſilius Zuiski,</hi> who aſſured them, that his Highneſs was not the Son of <hi>John Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius,</hi> but an Impoſtor; the Interment of <hi>Demetrius</hi> having by <hi>Boris</hi> been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his particular care. He confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed indeed, that in compliance with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Times, and to preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ruine, he had upon the Uproar in the City, when <hi>Demetrius</hi> was at the Gates, affirmed, that the Son of a Prieſt at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gleckz</hi> had been put in the place of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> and was killed upon the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his being the Prince; but that all this was a falſe ſuggeſtion of his own, to gratifie the fury of the people, who would have involved him in the ruines of <hi>Boris,</hi> had he deni'd it. Duke <hi>Baſilius Zuiski</hi> being apprehended, and the Rack pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him (the readieſt expedient for diſcoveries, and commonly uſed in that Country) he confeſſed the whole Charge; whereupon he was condemned to looſe his head: in order whereunto, being conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Scaffold, and placed upon his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93173:52"/>Knees to receive the fatal ſtroke, the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was ſtopped, and he not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but received into particular favour and nearneſs about <hi>Demetrius;</hi> who by an ill computation of his Affairs, took this way, firſt of expoſing and terrifying them as Criminals, and then taking them into his boſom as Friends; not conſidering, that diſobligations ſtick cloſer than kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and that they who had laid a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne for his ruine, were not to be divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it by the Courtſhip of words.</p>
            <p>If we look into the Affairs of the world, we ſhall find that the induſtrious man is not always rich; there are that riſe early, and yet eat the bread of carefulneſs: Wealth comes many times by a lucky hit, and a fortunate man is ſerved by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, or rather confederacie of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which in the judgment of right Reaſon would more probably tend to his ruine. <hi>Demetrius</hi> was a notable proof of this, in his prodigious riſe to the Empire of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> towards which he had done little more than perſonate a fit Subject to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed againſt the Intereſts of <hi>Boris.</hi> He owed his acquiſitions to Fortune, and the giddy humour of the wavering People; and his ruine to his own inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93173:53"/>and want of Conduct. He proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Family of <hi>Boris</hi> beyond what was conſiſtent with the State of Great Duke of <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> above ſeventy Families of that Kindred and Party being baniſhed by him, dividing the Spoils amongſt his forein Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliaries; giving out that he would plant the Kingdom with Colonies of ſtrange Nations. This fill'd the people with dreadful Apprehenſions of his Tyranny, and imbarked the Lords in the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, to find themſelves neglected in the adminiſtration of Juſtice, and the ſame managed according to the appetite and fancie of the <hi>Poles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all this, he gave the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> publike Churches and dwellings, and to all of that Perſwaſion the free Exerciſe of it. He had indeed himſelf been brought up in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, which might in ſome meaſure have warranted the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it in his own Chappel (though <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France</hi> diſpenſed with his former Faith upon his acceſſion to the Crown) endeavouring thereby to cure the Jealouſies of the people, who are no way ſo fervently engaged, as upon the the account of Conſcience. But <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> his publike deſpiſing of the Rites of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93173:53"/>the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and his ſo open endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to introduce that of the <hi>Latins,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd by the people, gave the firſt ſhock to their affections; and then his Habit, Garb, and Geſture being wholly Forein; the Commonalty, who ſee but the outſide, and make their judgment by that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Inclinations were ſo too. But what wrought moſt effectually upon thoſe that underſtood beſt, was, to diſcern a lightneſs in his Behaviour, bearing no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with ſo exalted a Quality as he bore in the world; little Gravity, and leſs Judgment in the manage of publike Affairs, meaſuring concerns of a different nature by the ſame Standard. From this ſhort-ſightedneſs, being but newly inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Royalty, he denounced War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Swedes;</hi> and with the ſame va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity writ to King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> that he would arm againſt the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Tartar,</hi> before he knew the Conſtitution of his own Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or by what eſtabliſhment an Army was to be maintained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> being Crowned Emperour, his next care was the matter of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; thoſe Paſſions were ſtill alive in him; and he had ſo much of the Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of a Lover, as to invite <hi>Marina</hi> to the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93173:54"/>participation of his Greatneſs: Upon this conſideration, he diſpatcht a ſplendid Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy into <hi>Poland,</hi> with a Preſent of the Jewels of the Crown of an ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. The Palatine of <hi>Sandomiria</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſerved well from him; but the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> abhorred the thought that the Treaſure of their Empire ſhould be havocked away upon that Negotiation, which no way quadrated with their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: however, this concern fell out ſo far luckily for <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that it reſpited his fate; for the Conſpirators having laid their deſigne to be put in execution ſome days after the diſpatch of this Embaſſie, held it adviſable to delay it till that was over; leſt by quitting their hands of their Great Duke, the Jewels of the Crown ſhould fall ſhort, and ſtay in <hi>Sandomiria.</hi> They therefore directed the Embaſſadors (who were alſo privy to the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) to make ſecret Articles with <hi>George Mniſeck</hi> the Palatine, <hi>Marina</hi>'s Father, before they made their Preſent of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to her, that ſhe ſhould bring them with her for her Ornament to <hi>Musko.</hi> There was at the ſame time diſpatched an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to the King and Commonwealth of <hi>Poland. Athanaſius Roſclovius</hi> the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93173:54"/>Treaſurer was made choice of for this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; who being admitted into the Kings preſence, did in the Name of his Maſter the Great Duke, preſent his very hearty acknowledgments to the King and Nobility for the ſeaſonable Aids he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them; declaring, that next under God, he derived all his Enjoyments from their Succours; and confeſſed, that had he not been vigorouſly owned by them, he muſt have wandered about the world, the pity of his Friends, and the ſcorn of his Enemies; whilſt an Uſurper poſſeſſed the Throne due to his Birth, and in which by their kindneſs he was ſeated in perfect peace. And as a Teſtimony of his further Gratitude, he had ſent his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to eſtabliſh a perfect Friendſhip and League Offenſive and Defenſive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Crowns, which was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all the Enemies of either Nation, eſpecially the common Enemy the <hi>Turk,</hi> who by the advantage of miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings amongſt Chriſtian Princes, got ground upon <hi>Europe.</hi> And that he might be the more naturally linked to the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> than the Ceremony of a League could extend to, he deſired the Kings permiſſion to Marry a Lady his Vaſſal, the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93173:55"/>Palatine of <hi>Sandomiria's</hi> Daughter: His Obligations to her Father being of that nature, that he knew not by what other means to contrive him a proportionable Recompence. He had not only owned and received him in his Exile, but engaged his Perſon and his Fortunes in his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; and he could not ſtand acquitted to himſelf, if he did not communicate to the Daughter of thoſe Enjoyments which were derived to him by the kindneſs and Courage of her Father. The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fully heard the Embaſſador, did with much Civility acknowledge the reſpect of the Great Duke in that Addreſs; that he wiſhed him all happineſs, and did hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly congratulate the ſucceſs of his Arms in the acquirement of his juſt rights: Adding further, that he did highly commend the pious reſentments he was pleaſed to have for the ſufferings of the oppreſſed Chriſtians. That he would willingly enter into a League with him againſt the Infidels, but that without the conſent of the Senate and Nobility of the Kingdom, he could determine nothing of that Nature. As to the Propoſal of his Marrying the Lady <hi>Marina,</hi> he ſhould not only have his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but his prayers alſo, that God would
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93173:55"/>render that Marriage auſpicious to both Kingdoms, by propagating between them a League of everlaſting Friendſhip. The King having expreſſed himſelf to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the Nuptials were within eight days after celebrated at <hi>Cracow,</hi> in the preſence of the King, and a great number of the Nobility of <hi>Poland,</hi> who were invited to this Royal Solemnity. His Majeſty deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Bride with his own hand to the Embaſſador, exhorting, that now ſhe was to be tranſplanted into another Nation, ſhe ſhould retain the Memory of her own Country, and her Fathers houſe: That ſhe ſhould do all good Offices betwixt both Nations; and above all things, that ſhe ſhould adhere to the Catholike Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wherein ſhe had been educated.</p>
            <p>The Church-Ceremonies being finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Majeſty entertained the Bride at a Royal Feaſt: Prince <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> his Son, the Princeſs of <hi>Sweden</hi> his Siſter, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine of <hi>Sandomiria,</hi> the Embaſſadors of <hi>Perſia,</hi> with all the Publike Miniſters then at Court, were invited to it; where at the laſt Courſe, thoſe Jewels ſent by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> to his <hi>Marina,</hi> and the Palatine her Father, to the value of two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Ducats, were ſerved up to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93173:56"/>inſtead of Fruit; which in ſo Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Aſſembly ſpoke the Magnificence of the <hi>Ruſs,</hi> and ſatisfaction of the Bride, to be courted at ſo valuable a Rate.</p>
            <p>About the end of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1607, the Bride, accompanied with the Embaſſadors of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation, the Palatine her Father, and Duke <hi>Conſtantine Wiſnioweski,</hi> and many other Perſons of Quality, and a ſplendid Train, having taken her leave of the King and Court of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſet forwards towards <hi>Musko;</hi> and on the 26th of <hi>April</hi> entred the Imperial City; being met by the way by <hi>Peter Boſmanno,</hi> attended by a great number of the Nobility, who conducted her into, and through the City, which was fitted and accommodated according to the Mode of the place upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; the Citizens being diſpoſed in their Formalities, to make a paſſage for her; and the ſtreets ecchoing her Welcome with the confuſed noiſes of the People, Trumpets, Cymbals, and other ſorts of Muſick. Being arrived at the Palace, ſhe was received by <hi>Demetrius</hi> with all the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable demonſtrations of Joy and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. She alſo was not wanting in a very obliging reception of the Great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that were preſented to her: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93173:56"/>a ſhort ſtay at Court, ſhe, after the manner of that Country, was conducted back to the Monaſtery where the Empreſs Dowager was, and where ſhe was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with an Appartment till the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Nuptials. Four days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe was removed from thence to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Appartment, prepared for her in Court, and Royally furniſhed, in order to her Marriage, which was the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Evening-prayer performed by the Patriarch. The Scepter, the Apple, and the Sword, were born before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour (the Great Duke of <hi>Muskovy</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that Title) and the Crown where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Empreſs was to be adorned, was carried before her upon a Cuſhion of Crimſon-Velvet, the Walls of the Church being hung with the ſame Livery, borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a deep Fringe of Gold. The Church-ceremony ended, they were both of them, with their Crowns upon their Heads, conducted back to the Palace (all the Cannon, Bells, and Muſick in the Town thundring, ringing, and playing without intermiſſion) where the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night was waſted in Feaſting, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, Balls, Maſks, and other Revels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Divertiſements of Kings and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93173:57"/>Great Perſonages. The Solemnity was continued the next and other following days, with all thoſe Delights and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which the Wit of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, no exceſs being ſpared which might improve the State and Magnificence of the Nuptials, till the 16th, the fatal Eve of the enſuing Tragedy.</p>
            <p>We have already given you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Emperours diſadvantages in the peoples eſteem, and by what ways he loſt ground amongſt them; his manner of living bearing no proportion with the ſtation wherein he was placed. He was much to ſeek in the Art of Government; neither had he diſcretion to make right application of the Advice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or indeed to be much amongſt them; his whole time being ſpent in the Society of Players, and ſuch other Mimicks, whereby his Nature being vitiated, he grew profuſe of the Treaſures of the Crown; which were ſo ſtrangely wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted amongſt his Rabble, that to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate their ſum, muſt needs raiſe the Readers admiration. They ſpeak of many Myriads of Gold and Silver, and twelve Buſhels of Pearl, and other Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; and to have this prodigious ſtock of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93173:57"/>Riches havocked away in a few months, rendered him the hate and ſcorn of the Nobles; which was heightned by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of forein Habits and Cuſtoms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; a people tenacious, even to Superſtition, of the old Manners and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies derived to them from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. All this being put together, did ſo enflame them, that what they firſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of a levity in their nature, was now purſued upon the ſcore of Juſtice, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to it by Divine Impulſion, to chaſtiſe this Muſhrome of a Prince, whoſe growth being prepoſterous, his end was likewiſe ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baſilius Zuiski,</hi> to the reſt of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to conſpire the ruine of this Prince, had now an addition of Revenge to add to the heap, for that publike reproach laid upon him, not to be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled by new favours. He confider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the next tranſgreſſion would be ſeverely puniſhed upon him, and that he only held his life at the will of a Tyrant, in whoſe power it was every moment to renew the old Judgment againſt him. He was not wanting to inflame the Lords and people with a zeal, as he termed it, to the Intereſt of their Countrey; who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93173:58"/>fire to that height, that they uſed to diſcourſe publickly concerning him: As for his Birth, it was baſe, being nothing of the Perſon or Manners of <hi>Jo. Baſilius</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in him; and as for his Religion, it was Heretical, being he ſcorned coming to the Churches; and if at any time he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared there, he manifeſted neither reſpect nor Devotion; &amp; by his Outlandiſh Modes, rendred his Preſence a reproach to the Place. He omitted bowing to St. <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> and other Saints which were had in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by that people; and in his Diet would ordinarily eat Calves-fleſh, which was held an abomination amongſt them. A bold fellow taking the liberty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at this rate in the hearing of ſome of the Guards, was ſeized upon, and brought before the Great Duke, who commanded him to the Rack; but ſome of the Council interpoſing, affirmed that the fellow was drunk, and that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Majeſty to reflect upon ſuch a worm; adding, that there was no cauſe for thoſe fears in a potent Empire, where he was able to raiſe Millions for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Sacred Perſon; ſo that he was fatally ſwayed to neglect the buſineſs: and being drowned in ſecurity, and led away
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93173:58"/>by the flatteries of a ſort of Buffoons, who fed his pleaſures with freſh Inventions, he left the Affairs of State to their own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, accounting himſelf ſecure in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of his new Guards of Foreiners, which were 300 men, <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> and divided into three Squadrons, commanded by Officers of their reſpective Nations. They were armed with Swords and Halberds, and cloathed for their every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days Habit in Scarlet, and for Feſtivals in Crimſon-Sattin. Theſe Guards were brought in the place of thoſe Foreiners whom he had diſmiſſed before; but the Gangrene was run too far to be cured by ſo feeble an Application.</p>
            <p>The Conſpirators, as we have already obſerved, had purpoſely ſuſpended the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their Deſigne, till the arrival of the Bride, eſpecially the return of the Jewels; with another Conſideration of no leſs Conſequence, as to time, which was judged moſt ſeaſonable at the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Nuptials, when <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his Court would be drowned in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baſilius Zuiski,</hi> allied by the Mother to the Blood-Royal of <hi>Muskow,</hi> had two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Eogdan,</hi> who were very
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93173:59"/>ſerviceable to his Deſigne in the raiſing of ſome thouſands of men in their ſeveral Territories, and eſpecially in their convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them into the City unobſerved. The Marriage of <hi>Demetrius</hi> conſpired with them in that part of it, as agreeable to the manner of the Eaſtern Nations; for the Nobility upon ſuch publike Solemnities do travel with a great Train of Friends and Attendants. There was upon the 16th of <hi>May</hi> a more Royal Feaſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than any had been held before, as if upon a particular reſpect and Honour to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nation; to which the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of that Country being invited, they inſtead of promiſing to come, returned their Anſwer by way of expoſtulation, that unleſs the ſame place were given them at the Great Dukes Table, as his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors enjoyed at <hi>Cracovia,</hi> they begg'd his Pardon for not obeying him; chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deny themſelves the Honour of his Invitation, than to receive it to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of their King and Commonwealth. This Punctilio being argued in Council, was oppoſed by the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Lords by all the Arguments they could deviſe; but the Great Duke over-ruled the Point, and would have the Foreiners gratified, as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93173:59"/>thoſe by whom he had aſcended up to his Throne. There happened during the Feaſt ſome paſſages of heat betwixt them; the <hi>Poles</hi> giving themſelves the liberty to reproach the want of Courage in the <hi>Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as having impoſed an Emperour upon them; which Language being received with ſcorn, had certainly been returned with ſeverity upon the place, but that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving whiſpered together, they choſe rather to haſten their Deſigne, and to Revenge all their Reſentments together. The cloſe of the Feaſt was the beginning of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray: for when all the world was ſteeped in Jollity, giving themſelves up to Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and Revels, the very Guards being diſmiſſed upon this occaſion; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, who had been kept waking upon other Deſignes, had by break of day next morning poſſeſs'd themſelves of the moſt conſiderable Parts and Avenues of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and <hi>Baſilius Zuiski</hi> placing himſelf in the Head of them, with a Croſs in one hand, and his Sable drawn in the other, led them on towards the Heart of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He had cauſed the great Bell (the common ſignal of Alarms) to be toll'd, and a confuſed Cry to be ſpread about the Streets, that the <hi>Poles</hi> were in Arms, upon
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93173:60"/>a Deſigne of putting the whole City to the Sword. The People being raiſed with this apprehenſion, fell upon the <hi>Poles</hi> in their Quarters, and deſtroyed them before they could wake to ſee their danger. The tolling of the Bell, with the greater noiſe of the people in the Streets, had rouzed <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who calling to them of his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber to enquire the Cauſe of that Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, they anſwer, it muſt neceſſarily be ſome Fire. <hi>Boſmanno</hi> being commanded to underſtand the true reaſon of it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens to the window that looked towards the Streets, and obſerved them full of armed men; and aſking the Cauſe of it at that unſeaſonable hour, they cried, they would ſpeak with that Impoſtor the Great Duke, who had betrayed them into the hands of the <hi>Poles. Boſmanno</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, and ſtruck with the apprehenſion of the danger, ordered ſuch of the Guards as lay next at hand, to be called to their Arms, and to make good the Palace; and going in to <hi>Demetrius: My Lord</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>it is now too late that you have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of my Counſel; the Conſpirators are in Arms, and the Treaſon at your Door.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Boſmanno</hi> was ſpeaking, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the other Party had preſſed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93173:60"/>through ſome of the Guards half aſleep, and called to the Duke aloud, <hi>Thou falſe Great Duke, why comest thou not out to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie that demand of the people, who are in the Streets expecting thee? Boſmanno</hi> abhorring ſo great an Inſolence, ſnatcht a Sable which hung by upon the Wall, and at one blow laid this bold man dead at his feet. <hi>Demetrius</hi> flung himſelf out of Bed, and covering his Body with what was next hand, ſnatched a Halbard from one of the Guards, with which going into the Anti-chamber where the Conſpirators were, entring with fury in his looks, he flies upon them, and put the forwardeſt to retreat: but they preſſing in the ſecond time, and ſome of them ſhooting at him, he judged it adviſable to withdraw; whilſt <hi>Boſmanno</hi> advancing up towards them, deſired they would pleaſe in a peaceable manner to ſignifie their deſires, and he would undertake to have them gratified. <hi>Michael Tatiſſon,</hi> one of the Ringleaders, anſwered him, <hi>Thou Son of a Whore, doſt thou take upon thee to preſcribe Rules to the Nibility and people of</hi> Ruſſia? And drawing out a long Knife which hung by his ſide, ſtab'd him to the heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he fell down dead before him upon
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93173:61"/>the place. The Guards being now no longer able to reſiſt, were kill'd as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, whiles the poor Duke retiring from Chamber to Chamber with ſome few of his Servants, was at laſt come to ſuch a place, where there was no further paſſage: he hurried on by his deſpair, flung himſelf out of a Window, forty foot from the ground. His fall was ſo great, that he vomited Blood with the cruſh of it; but his fears making him ſtrong, he ſcrambled to his Guard of <hi>Muskovites</hi> in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. The Conſpirators in the mean time miſſing their prey, made Booty of what elſe they found in the Palace; and cauſing themſelves to be guided to the Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Empreſs, who had hid her ſelf, they aſked for her: but the frighted Ladies wanting courage to reply, the old Lady Palatine of <hi>Samoc,</hi> confident in the Prerogative of her gray-hairs, told, ſhe was upon the noiſe fled to her Father's Lodgings. They ſearched the Room, and not finding her, revenged their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments in ſuch a vile ſort of unclean Expreſſions, as is not fit for any Language but the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> to repeat; and the Lords by this ſtrange irruption tranſported in their very minds to all exceſs of Debauchery,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93173:61"/>ſeized each of them upon one of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; none eſcaping them but the old Lady Palatine, who was ſpared upon the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her wrinkles, and another Lady that ſate ſick in a Chair; till one of them obſerving ſome extraordinary motion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her lower parts, pull'd her up; where the poor affrighted <hi>Marina</hi> was diſcovered, but with ſo great a Majeſty in her Aſpect, that they her Enemies ſeemed more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed than ſhe, and withdrew, offering her no kinde of violence; which is not the leaſt Argument for the Dominion of Beauty, able to ſubdue the Spirits of men, when they are become ſavage. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators having received ſome advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <hi>Demetrius</hi> was retreated to the Fort for ſhelter, they all made thither; where after ſome confuſed attempts, but greater threatnings to force the place, that unfortunate Perſon was put into their hands. They led him away in Triumph, as the Spoils of War; and the Rabble were not wanting to aggravate his afflictions by their reproachful Behaviour and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; to which he made no reply at all: but ſeeing his ſtately Palace pillaged, and ſtained with the Blood of his Servants and Friends, and others of them hurried away
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93173:62"/>to Priſon, and abuſed in his preſence, he could not reſiſt to manifeſt his reſentments by his Tears. And to add yet to his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, they covered him with an old ragged Coat, and ſo expoſed him to publike view, not without the ſcorn of mocks and taunts, which none can have ſo great a ſenſe of, as he that had been poſſeſſed of ſo eminent a Grandeur. And to leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unattempted that might imbitter his Soul (beſides their juſtling him, pointing their fingers at his eyes, plucking him by the Noſe, and ſuch rude freedoms) they aſk him if he were <hi>Demetrius</hi> or <hi>Gris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko;</hi> and what Devil had tempted him to profane the Blood-Royal of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> by ſo baſe a mixture. He expreſſing a greater ſenſe of this than all his other ſufferings anſwered, <hi>You all of you know that I am Great Duke of</hi> Muſkovy, <hi>Crowned in the face of the whole world, and received, as I am, So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſeemed ſtartled at this poſitive affirmation and that being the main Point of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, they would after all their brutiſh vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences ſeem to do him right in that: in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93173:62"/>order whereto, they all deſired <hi>Baſilius Zuiski</hi> to attend the Empreſs for her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration; which he did accordingly: And if we will credit common report in this matter, it is rendred, that the Empreſs did renounce him now, as poſitively as ſhe had owned him before; affirming, that her <hi>Demetrius</hi> was murthered by the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of <hi>Boris;</hi> but that ſeeing how this Impoſtor had poſſeſſed himſelf of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſhe judged it ſafer to own him for hers (being ſhe could not by denying him divert the people) as a means to procure her not only her enlargement, but the enjoyment of her State and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that indeed ſhe was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome good will for him, as having revenged her injuries upon the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Uſurper <hi>Boris;</hi> but that in touth he was no Son of hers, neither had ſhe ever ſeen him before that time that he met her upon her return to <hi>Musko. Zuiski</hi> returned with this anſwer from the Empreſs; which having reported to the people, a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ſtept out of the croud, with a Piſtol in his hand, and coming up to him, ſpake with a loud voice, <hi>Thou infamous Traytor, 'tis enough thou haſt lived hitherto to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the people of</hi> Ruſſia; <hi>take the reward
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93173:63"/>of thy Ambition for ſtaining the Sacred Blood-Royal by thy Impoſture;</hi> and with that ſhot him to the heart, whereupon he fell dead upon the place; and the people, whoſe love and hate are always in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, ſeeing him laid along, wounded his carkaſs with their Swords and Pikes, as if they could never kill him enough; and to ſhew their malice did not end with his life, they dragged him out of the Hall by the heels to the place where the Body of <hi>Boſmanno</hi> lay; the Rabble following after with Outcries and Exclamations, as if he had yet ſenſe left him. And thus was the ſplendor of theſe Nuptials dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Tragick end of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who was only ſuffered to taſte the joys of a Crown and a fair Bride, and then ſnatched from them; as if the whole had been a Dream, which upon the wakening vaniſhed away.</p>
            <p>The Barbarity of the enraged Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude reſted not here; it extended to his inanimate Corps: for having laid his Body naked, they poſt a cord through it, which being faſtened to his private parts, they tied it to <hi>Boſmanno</hi>'s foot; and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging both the Bodies through the Streets into the Market-place, they lay expoſed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93173:63"/>there for that whole day; which was done to ſatisfie the world, that the Great Duke being killed, it concern'd the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in order to their own ſafety to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of another choice. I ſhall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Readers ears with the further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities offered to the dead Carkaſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what Heathens would have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, much leſs acted.</p>
            <p>The contagion of this Tragedy extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf to the <hi>Poles</hi> quartered up and down the City, who with the like inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity were pillaged and murthered by the multitude. There was a mixture of malice and cunning in their cruelty; for in thoſe parts of the City where the death of their great Duke was not yet known; the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> came with a formal Command to the <hi>Poles,</hi> that it was the Dukes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they ſhould attend him unarmed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he would have nothing of force or terror in the celebration of his Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and the poor <hi>Poles</hi> giving credit to this deceit, expoſed themſelves tamely to the ſlaughter which was committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Many warned by the cruelty exerciſed upon their Friends, diſputed their lives, and fell not unrevenged. Some defended their Quarters; amongſt the reſt,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93173:64"/>one <hi>Vitenski,</hi> a young <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentleman of great Quality, made good his with a great ſlaughter of the Rabble, till not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to force him, they cauſed Cannon to be drawn before the houſe. Upon that he hung out a white Flag in token of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; and then cauſing his Servants to caſt out handfuls of Gold and Silver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Rabble, he engaged them all in the ſcramble; and then being well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by his Friends and Servants, he ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon them, forcing his paſſage through the lives of many a <hi>Ruſſian,</hi> and making way with his Sword, bore all before him; till being ſpent with toil, and the carnage he had made, he was ready to be overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their numbers, when ſome <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Lords coming ſeaſonably to the place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed their power, and reſcued him out of the hands of the people. Duke <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Wiſnioweski</hi> and the Palatine being in their ſeveral Palaces, which were large and ſtrong, received many of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men which fled from the peoples rage in to them, and defended themſelves maugre the force that was prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; killing a great number of that giddy multitude who attempted them. The houſes of Embaſſadors were
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93173:64"/>in the height of this fury conſidered as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, they only of all Foreiners eſcaped untouched. Many Merchants upon account of their Traffick with <hi>Poland</hi> were pillaged and murthered; and at this time they, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Stranger-Merchants and Jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, were more numerous, and had more Riches about them than ordinary, in order to the great confluence of people at <hi>Musko,</hi> to celebrate the great Dukes Nuptials.</p>
            <p>This Maſſacre (as no violent thing is perpetual) ended with the day, in which there fell twelve hundred of the <hi>Poles,</hi> and four hundred of the <hi>Ruſſians.</hi> The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night was accompanied with horror and ſilence, as if guilty of the more diſmal preceding day. The next Morning the <hi>Boyarians</hi> being recollected, went to Council, where the firſt thing propoſed, was, the Election of a New Prince, as the only Expedient to prevent future Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions. <hi>Zuiski</hi> obſerving the temper of the Nobility, and that many had an eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; the better to diſpoſe them in his favour, and to remove ſuch Objections as might be urged againſt him, is ſaid to have ſpoke in the Aſſembly to them after this manner:</p>

                  <p>THat Station wherein God hath placed me a Member of this Empire, as it rendred my Actions of an extraordinary Nature in theſe late Revolutions, ſo it hath plunged me upon ſome inevitable, though irregular Expedients; without which it had been impoſſible to reſcue the Honour of the Empire from the Confuſion ready to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm it. But as you, my Lords, are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for me of our Diſorders, ſo am I to my ſelf, of that reverence I bear to our Laws, and to the Majeſty of him that is ſeated upon the Throne. Theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did ſo long reſtrain me, that I had almoſt ſuffered my ſelf to be born down with the Torrent, rather than tread a way to redeem millions of People from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation. But a juſt zeal to my native Country, and the Honour of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, having at length ſubdued the temper of my Nature, I ſhall inſtead of excuſing what is done, bemoan to you the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our Fate, that hath left us no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to avoid Death and Confuſion, but through it. To what extremes were we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, when the Sword of Juſtice muſt be committed to the hands of the Multitude
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93173:65"/>(who commonly ſtrike blindfold) and that nothing but Blood, Horror, and Confuſion could preſerve us either a Being, or a Name! But the work is done, the Tyrant is chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the aſhes of our dead Emperour in ſome ſort appeaſed: We are now to look forward; and in order thereto to conſider, how God the Diſpoſer of Empires, had by a long and uninterrupted Series of Princes, devolved this greateſt of Chriſtian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms upon the Perſon of <hi>John Baſilius;</hi> whoſe great Mind not enduring to be reſtrained within the Bounds of his antient Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, extended his Conqueſts by the acceſſion of two great Kingdoms to the Empire; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

My ſeveral Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Truſts under that Great Prince in Peace and War, in Negotiations and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſies, and Battles, as it gave me a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knowledge of, and Honour for ſo Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious an Emperour, ſo it gave me an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into the Myſteries of State, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>oncerns of the Empire, that I think I may, without vanity, aſſert my actings, as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſpecting the Honour of my Prince,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93173:66"/>and the ſafety of my Country. But <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> being dead, our Glory (as if he had been the Soul of our Nation) withered away under the Conduct of <hi>Theodorus;</hi> whoſe infirm, melancholick Complexion, bearing no proportion with the Courage of his People, they ſeemed to degenerate from what they had formerly been; and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs of the Great Dutcheſs conſpiring with the indiſpoſedneſs of the Prince, our Government was no longer ſupported by his Vertue, but rendred a Prey to the Deſignes of her Favorites. And though her unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs had by our known Laws actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiated that Lady from the Emperors bed, yet by the artifice of that worſt of men (whoſe Name ought to be in horror with us) ſhe was continued near him, whilſt that curſed Brother of hers, <hi>Boris,</hi> having thus, and by the Murther of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> deprive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Then was it, that our Banks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born down in the Extinction of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family, our Calamities broke in upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> like a Deluge; and ſuch miſeries as were
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93173:66"/>not within humane Comprehenſions, were acted upon us by the vileſt of Monſters; whoſe Villanies were ſuch, that had we not our own Teſtimony for our Sufferings, we ſhould never credit that of any other. It was from the Senſe of this bleeding Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I judged it neceſſary to cloſe with any Pretenſions, for the Extirpation of ſo abhorr'd a Tyranny; judging it a leſs evil to own the ſuppoſed <hi>Demetrius,</hi> than to ſit under the Cruelties of <hi>Boris;</hi> and no other way being then viſible, I was conſtrained by the Aid of an Impoſtor, to revenge the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family upon a bloody <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper: In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereto, I recommended him to you, my Lords, and to the whole people, as the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir. But this Muſhroom thus ſet at the Helm, immediately attempts to hurry us from one confuſion to another; nothing of ours was Sacred in his eye, the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Fore-fathers was become our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, our antient Laws trampled on and violated, new Faſhions and uneaſie Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms introduced upon us, our Liberties ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and the Government put into the hands of Strangers. Theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made me break through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to reſiſt the Impoſtor, and with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of my life to refuſe him thoſe Honors
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93173:67"/>which were due to a lawful Prince. 'Tis true, I fell into his hands in the Attempt; and that he ſpared my life, when the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner was ready to take it from me: But I owe it him but as to a Thief, who had no right over it; and who when he might, did not take it away. Though this might oblige any other of leſs zeal for his Country, yet I, who lay under greater obligations to that, and that never cared to live for my ſelf alone, was after ſome reluctancies upon the ſence of ingratitude reſolved to embark my Fame in the ſame Veſſel that had the charge of the Common-Intereſt; chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Shipwrack with that, than to lie ſecure with my own Concerns in the Harbour. That which gave life to my Endeavours, was the faithful concurrence of you, my Lords, whoſe Zeal and Courage in ſo glorious an Attempt, as it contributes to the eternal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of your Memory, ſo it receives Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from the Great Diſpoſer of Empires, who hath ſignalized his Approbation of our Actings in the Event. And now, my Lords, being we are delivered from our Bondage, and have once more day before us, that the Royal Line is extinguiſhed, and that we are in the quality of a free people, it behoves us, as good Patriots, to provide for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93173:67"/>of theſe vaſt Territories, in a way conſiſtent with their antient Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: in order whereto, let us look into the Commonwealth, for what is denied us in the Royal-Family; and pitch upon a Perſon fitly qualified for the Greatneſs and Honour of the Charge he is to undertake. Let his Extraction be Eminent, and of the first Rank, that the Glory of the Empire may not receive diminution from the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Blood, or the Nobles ſcorn Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Inferior; and let his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue be ſo Illuſtrious, that they have no room to envy his Precedencie. But above all things, make choice of a zealous Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Obſerver of our Religion, in the Rites and Ceremonies of our Anceſtors; which beſides that it draws down the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Heaven upon us, it checks all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies hatcht under the Mask of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Conſcience. Let your Prince be a Perſon of years and Experience in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State, conſidering that beſides our diſorders within, we are ſurrounded with Enemies from without, who lie in wait to invade us, and are ready to cloſe with any diſtempered Spirits for our confuſion. Let him be one who will account Juſtice and Temperance a more firm Support, than
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93173:68"/>Pride and Arrogance to the Royal Majeſty; who meaſures his ſafety from the Affection of his People, and his Treaſure from the Preſervation of their Propriety, and the Splendor of their condition. When I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at this rate, you will poſſibly ſay, Where can you point us to ſuch a Perſon of theſe Accompliſhments? I know 'tis dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to do ſo; but it being the duty of a worthy Commonwealths-man, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Honour of this great Aſſembly, to propoſe the best things: Let us in the Name of God proceed to our Election with all neceſſary prudence and ſincerity.</p>

            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:93173:69"/>
            <p>
               <hi>BAſilius Zuiski</hi> being thus choſen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, his Coronation was haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to prevent any change in the Affections of the People; which being performed with the uſual Ceremonies of State, he took upon him the Adminiſtration of the Government, placing Guards upon the Lodgings of the Palatine and Duke <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioweski,</hi> as well to obſerve their motion, as to preſerve them from injury. He alſo cauſed the Lady <hi>Marina</hi> to be delivered to her Father with what was hers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Jewels of the Crown preſented to her by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> which were reſtored again into the Treaſury. And to put ſome Countenance upon the late Tumults, he publiſhed a Declaration againſt the ſlain <hi>Demetrius,</hi> rendring him guilty of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, Witchcraft, Hereſie, and Tyranny. The People, as 'tis their nature, fond of what is new, and of their own Creation, received all that came from him as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and perceiving he took delight to vilifie and traduce <hi>Demetrius</hi> in his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, they to Complement his humour, digged up his poor Carkaſs out of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Grave which had been given it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three days lying above ground; and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93173:69"/>after a repetition of barbarities upon him, they burn the body, and ſcatter the aſhes in the Air.</p>
            <p>And now the Great Duke caſts about how to eſtabliſh his Intereſt abroad; in order whereto, he renewed thoſe Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondencies which had been held betwixt that Crown and forein Nations, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Letters to ſeveral Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, wherein he gave a Narrative of the troubles of <hi>Muskovy,</hi> and his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Throne. A Copy of his Letter to our King <hi>James,</hi> is extant in our Country-man <hi>Purchas</hi> his <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> to which I refer the Reader; it being too long to inſert in this place. Which though it be in a rude Copy of Language, yet ſpeaks that Nation to be men that underſtand the compaſs of their buſineſs, though not much of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</p>
            <p>And thus ended the moſt unhappy <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> an unparallel'd Example of both the extremes of Fortune, and the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of Popular Favour; for being by them brought from a Convent to a Crown, he was by them alſo precipitated from ſo ſplendid a height, into a calamitous abyſs of miſery. But whether he was truly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93173:70"/>
               <hi>Baſilius</hi> his Son or not, is uncertain, and will ever be ſo; nay, it is queſtionable whether he was ſlain in this <hi>Muskovitiſh</hi> Tumult, or afterwards: for Fame, as ſhe had divulged him long ſince ſlain, ſo now when he ſeemed dead to all men, ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain raiſed him, and expoſed him in a ſecond Reſurrection. For the Tumult was ſcarce appeaſed, when a report ran through the City, that he was ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; another having in the hurry been kill'd for him, &amp; not poſſibly to be known, being ſo unhumanely mangled, for all his being publikely expoſed. 'Twas fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muttered, that he had diſguiſed and withdrawn himſelf betimes, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the danger upon ſwift Horſes, which he had taken out of his own Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Neither was this Rumor without appearance, there having been ſeveral Stalls in the ſaid Stables found empty of their Horſes, which he afterwards affirmed he had made uſe of in his flight. Such who wiſhed him well, believed this noiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſired it; and others who did abhor the flagitious Cruelty of what was acted, or preferr'd turmoils before quiet, did not contradict it. But the buſineſs was put out of Controverſie, when after a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93173:70"/>few days <hi>Demetrius</hi> did indeed appear; but whether the true, or an Impoſtor (which I am apt to believe) is not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. Whoever he was, the <hi>Poles</hi> flock to him, to revenge their Maſſacred Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, and the Violation of the Laws of Hoſpitality; they acknowledge him for the true <hi>Demetrius</hi> Emperour of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kovy,</hi> and make War upon <hi>Zuiski</hi> with ſuch revengeful obſtinacie, that it coſt him his Crown, his Liberty, and laſtly, his Life, and conſumed them an immenſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Men and Money. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late things in order: During the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Tumults at <hi>Musko, George Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copski,</hi> Lord-Keeper of the Great Seal, and faithful to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſeeing the irreſiſtible Torrent that was broke in upon them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for his own eſcape out of <hi>Musko,</hi> and taking two <hi>Poles</hi> with him in <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Habit, got away unobſerved. The deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place for his Retreat was <hi>Putiwol</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that had ſtood vigorous for <hi>Demetrius</hi> in the Infancie of his Acquiſitions. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got about 30 Mile on his way, upon his leaving the Inn where he had refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, inſtead of aſking the Hoſteſs what was to pay, gave her a handful of Gold; with which ſhe being equally tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93173:71"/>with amazement and joy, deſired to know the Author of that Profuſion. <hi>Schacopski</hi> anſwered, As for my ſelf, I am a Prince and Lord in <hi>Musko;</hi> but my place is to attend upon the Great Duke, whom the Rebels think they have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, but you have had the Honour to harbour him this day under your Roof. Having ſaid this on purpoſe to raiſe a Rumor of his being yet alive, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately take Horſe, and poſt away to the River <hi>Occa;</hi> where being wafted over in the Ferry, they gave the Waterman ſix Gold Crowns; and told him, he had had the Honour to ſerve the Great Duke <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> (pointing at him that paſſed under that Character) and promiſing the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terman high Preferments for that days Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if he ever ſhould be reſtored to his Empire; charging him, as the Hoſteſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the mean time, to keep their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, leſt they ſhould be purſued. Being landed, they mount again, and poſt on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Putiwol,</hi> taking all opportunities by the way, to poſſeſs the world of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> his being alive, and eſcaped out of the reach of the Conſpirators. <hi>Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copski</hi> being arrived at <hi>Putiwol,</hi> ſent his two <hi>Poles</hi> forwards to <hi>Sandomiria,</hi> with
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93173:71"/>Letters to the Palatine's Lady of what had befaln in <hi>Musko,</hi> and to aſſure her, that the Great Duke, her Son-in-law, was eſcaped ſeaſonably, and hoped ſuddenly to be in the head of an Army, to revenge upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subjects their Treaſon &amp; Diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Schacopski</hi> having made his diſpatches to <hi>Sandomiria,</hi> applied himſelf to the Citizens of <hi>Putiwol,</hi> deſiring Audience from them in the Name of the Great Duke <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his Maſter; which being granted, and an Aſſembly called, he took the liberty to enlarge upon the unheard-of Barbarities of the Citizens of <hi>Musko,</hi> how they had ſlaughtered the Inhabitants without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of quality; laying their malice ſo deep, as to attempt the Murther of the Emperour; but that he had been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Providence of God, who had always an eſpecial regard on his Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: By whoſe Impulſe, having taken ſome of his beſt Horſes out of his own Stable, He, with a ſmall, but faithful Company under his conduct, had withdrawn himſelf betimes out of the Tumult: That he was retired to his Allies in <hi>Poland,</hi> for Aid againſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Subjects; having left him to attend the Affairs of the Empire in his abſence, with an expreſs direction to apply himſelf
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93173:72"/>in his Maſters Name to that Loyal Town, to aſſure them that he was alive, and well, and preparing to vindicate the Honour of his Empire out of the hands of the Conſpirators. <hi>Schacopski</hi> was not wanting in Arguments to provoke the Zeal of the Citizens to the Service of their Prince; how great an Honour it would be to that City, to be the only place in that vaſt Empire to which their Prince durſt commit his Perſon and Intereſt: That he would not fail to ſtamp upon them particular marks of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Reſentments for their ſeaſonable Loyalty; and that it would be their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory to bring in their Great Duke, and to place him upon his juſt Throne; cleanſing the ſame from the pollutions of Conſpiracies and Uſurpations. His Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory had that effect, as to inflame them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place with Reſolutions to declare for <hi>Demetrius</hi> as their Leige-Lord and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; that their Lives and whatever elſe was dear to them ſhould be at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that in the mean time, till he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured them with his preſence, they would ſubmit to his Commiſſioner the Lord Keeper; who having gained this great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, failed not to ſollicite the Neighbour-Country. He diſpatched Poſts into <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:93173:72"/>inviting all that had the courage in behalf of an injured Prince, to repair to <hi>Putiwol.</hi> The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> flock in; and in four weeks he had perſwaded fourteen Caſtles in thoſe parts, to follow the Example of <hi>Putiwol;</hi> taking a new Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance from them in the name of <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> againſt all his oppoſers, and particularly againſt the bloody Uſurper <hi>Zuiski.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zuiski</hi> alarmed with the Rumour of a new <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and that a conſiderable party had declared for him, under the Command of <hi>Iſthoma,</hi> a great Lord, made all the ſpeed poſſible in his Levies, to check that growing evil; and encountring that <hi>Demetrian</hi> General, was totally defeated: Who preſſing upon him, as Maſter of the field, blocked him up in the Imperial City, and ſate down with his Army at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of about a Mile from it. Whilſt <hi>Iſthoma</hi> lay incamped there, there came up to him an Army of twelve thouſand <hi>Coſſacks</hi> under the Command of <hi>John Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutnich,</hi> a Souldier of Name, who was come out of <hi>Poland,</hi> and produced a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from <hi>Demetrius</hi> to Command in Chief as General; which <hi>Iſthoma,</hi> after ſome diſputing, was conſtrained to yield to, but apprehended the affront with ſo
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93173:73"/>great diſdain, that he reſolved not to brook it, or after having chaſed <hi>Zuiski</hi> out of the the field, to truckle under the Command of <hi>Polutnich,</hi> who was about to raviſh from him the Palms due to his Victory. Hurried on by theſe Sentiments of ſcorn, he riſked the blaſting of his Honour, by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary tenderneſs of it; and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched 9000 of the Army, he went over to <hi>Zuiski</hi> with them; who gave him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſutable to the ſeaſonableneſs of the kindneſs; and much more, when <hi>Iſthoma</hi> had aſſured him that no <hi>Demetrius</hi> had appeared in <hi>Putiwol;</hi> and that the whole trouble of his Affairs was formed by the contrivance of the ſubtle <hi>Schacopski,</hi> who to render himſelf conſiderable, had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the people with a ſuggeſtion of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> his being alive. This Relation from <hi>Iſthoma</hi> was immediately communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the people; who, however, were not without their fears; and therefore ſent out to <hi>Polutnich,</hi> demanding of him to ſee their Lord <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and they would caſt themſelves at his feet for pardon: and immediately <hi>Polutnich</hi> returned anſwer, that in truth <hi>Demetrius</hi> was in <hi>Poland,</hi> that he had there ſeen and ſpoke with him, and received from his own hand the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93173:73"/>miſſion by which he then acted as General. Some of the Lords ſent again, to aſſure him that the Great Duke <hi>Demetrius</hi> had been kill'd in <hi>Musko,</hi> in the face of the whole people; that if any one aſſumed that Name, he was an Impoſtor: Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him further to quit that counterfeit Prince, and joyn himſelf to the Party of the rightful Emperour, who would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his Loyalty with Preferments and Honours ſutable to the Merits of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in preventing the effuſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Blood, &amp; the harraſſing of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the guilt whereof would lie heavy at his door, if he ſhould not hearken to their wholſome invitation.

On the other ſide, they were to expect nothing but the indignation of an incenſed Lord, and of an enraged Souldiery. This <hi>Polut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich</hi> was a <hi>Muskoviter</hi> born, but had been brought up amongſt the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,</hi> and being taken priſoner by the <hi>Turks,</hi> had ſerved as a Gally-ſlave againſt the Chriſtians, till amongſt others, he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to be releaſed by the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and paſſing through <hi>Poland</hi> towards his own Country, he met at <hi>Sandomiria</hi> with this new <hi>Demetrius;</hi> to whom being preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he received conditions from him, and engaged himſelf in his Service, as General of his Army; upon which account he lay now encamped before <hi>Musko.</hi> But the Citizens perceiving that no <hi>Demetrius</hi> did yet appear, took heart; and making an unanimous conjunction with <hi>Zuiskis</hi> Troops, made a furious Sally upon <hi>Polut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich;</hi> who not able to ſuſtain the aſſault of an hundred thouſand men, was forced to quit his ground, and ſave himſelf by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93173:74"/>retreat, in <hi>Caluga. Zuiski</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the Succeſs, returned Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant into <hi>Musko;</hi> and having modelled his Army for a march, advanced towards <hi>Caluga,</hi> and ſat down before it; but was forced by the Valour and Conduct of the Lord Keeper to raiſe his Siege. However, having recruited his Troops, he marched again to find out the Enemy; and both Armies being met, were upon the point to encounter, when <hi>Schacopski</hi> being terrified with the unexſpected defection of 4000 of his men, not daring to hazard the reſt in ſo great a conſternation, was conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quit the Field, retreating to <hi>Thula,</hi> whither he was hotly purſued by <hi>Zuiski,</hi> and the place cloſely beſieged, in ſuch ſort, that not having had time to put in Proviſions, they were ſoon reduced to the eating of Horſes, Dogs, Cats, Rats, and ſuch other things as were abhorring to nature. This quickly raiſed the Citizens into a mutinous poſture againſt <hi>Schacopski</hi> and <hi>Polutnich,</hi> as being betrayed by them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an imaginary ſuppoſition, to adhere to a fictitious perſon that had not a being; elſe that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> if he had been alive, would not have failed in ſuch a juncture of his Affairs, to have aſſerted his Intereſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93173:75"/>in Perſon. <hi>Polutnich</hi> proteſted to them, that he had ſeen and diſcourſed with a young man in <hi>Poland</hi> of about 28 years of Age, who called himſelf <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and was there acknowledged for ſuch; but whether he were really ſo or no, he could not poſitively affirm, having never ſeen him before. But if the people would have a little patience, and ſtand by him, he would ſend out ſuch a truſty Meſſenger as they ſhould make choice of, one that knew the Prince, to inform them of the truth, and to ſee what hopes of relief was to be expected from him. This being reſolved upon, an Emiſſary was ſent out, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the night, and the careleſsneſs of the Beſiegers; the Citizens reſolving with patience to expect his return. In the mean time no <hi>Demetrius</hi> did appear; that perſon whom <hi>Schacopski</hi> had deſigned to aſſume his Name and Fortunes, being a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentleman, who thought it more ſafe to depend upon a plentiful eſtate of his own, than to change his private condition for the hopes and hazard of the Empire of <hi>Muskovy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Empire can never Eſcheat for want of an Heir: a new <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Stage, coming out of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the forge of all the contrivances and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93173:75"/>troubles of <hi>Muskovy.</hi> He was conducted to <hi>Putiwol</hi> by <hi>Micharetski</hi> a great <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lord; and acknowledged there, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all imaginary honour, as their Prince and Sovereign. After a ſhort ſtay there, he marched with what force he could make to <hi>Staradub,</hi> where he met the Meſſenger from <hi>Thula;</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into his preſence, was ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the ſight of a perſon only very like <hi>Demetrius,</hi> but in reality not he. <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> obſerving his diſſatisfaction, judged it more adviſable to carry the news of his relief in the head of his Army, than put himſelf into the hands of one who might raiſe in the City a prejudice againſt his Perſon and Intereſts. This precaution was not unreaſonable, though it proved fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; the Garriſon of <hi>Thula</hi> being reduced to thoſe ſtraights, eſpecially for want of water, (and ſuppoſing by the Meſſengers long ſtay that he was fallen into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands) they came to Terms for a Surrender; which being honourable as to the condition of Souldiers, <hi>Zuiski</hi> ſwore to obſerve, but failed in the performance; for he cauſed <hi>Peter Fedrowits,</hi> an eminent perſon, to be hanged, and <hi>Polutnich</hi> to be caſt into a loathſome priſon, where he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93173:76"/>was miſerably famiſhed to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thula</hi> being reduced in this manner, the <hi>Demetrian Coſſacks</hi> quitted their own Party as deſperate, to follow that of the Conqueror; and were with ſome other Troops ſent by <hi>Zuiski</hi> to proſecute the Siege of <hi>Caluga,</hi> the Enemies principal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. The Quarters were ſcarce mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out before the Town, when there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a deſperate Mutiny amongſt the Souldiers, propagated by the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> as was ſuppoſed, upon the news of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his recovery and approach. This gave ſo great a terror to the reſt of the Army, that being poſſeſſed with a pannick fear, they ran out of the Camp in the night in ſo great diſorder, that they left their Baggage behind them, and made towards <hi>Musko</hi> with all their might. The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves left to their own diſpoſal, called upon the Garriſon to receive them into the Town, aſſuring them of their friendſhip, and the flight of the <hi>Ruſſians.</hi> The Garriſon wondring their deliverance ſhould be ſo near and ſo unexſpected, could not upon the ſudden (being agitated with the paſſions of hope and fear) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve what to do; until being aſcertained by their Spies and Parties they had ſent
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93173:76"/>out, of the truth of it, they opened their Gates and arms to receive their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and joyntly with them plundered the Camp, bringing into the Town in Triumph all the Proviſions and Cannon of the ſame. The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> themſelves would not enter into the City, but haſtening to meet <hi>Demetrius,</hi> joyned themſelves to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, with the mutual congratulations of both ſides.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> being thus revived, many <hi>Muskovites,</hi> and very many <hi>Lithuan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But the Supplies from <hi>Poland</hi> were the main appay of his Army. Duke <hi>Roman Roſinski</hi> being engaged in the Quarrel, ſent great Forces under the Command
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:93173:77"/>of <hi>Walareski,</hi> a Creature of his, out of that Country; and a while after, Duke <hi>Adam Wiſnioweski, Tiſchievicz, Charlinski, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elski,</hi> men of Eminence; and at length <hi>Roſinski</hi> in perſon came up with the reſt of the Army; and at the ſame time there arrived at the Rendezvouz a Recruit of 8000 <hi>Zoporenſian</hi> and <hi>Dumenſian Coſſacks;</hi> ſo that the Army being now great, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited into one body, <hi>Roſinski</hi> by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of all the Peers and great Officers was declared General. <hi>Baſilius Zuiski</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the great growth and progreſs of his Rival, cauſed new Levies to be made, with which having formed an Army of 170000, though moſt raw men, he placed his Brother <hi>Demetrius Zuiski</hi> in the head of them, with Orders to find out and fight the Enemy. And now behold both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in ſight of each other, encamped near the Town of <hi>Bolchow!</hi> The firſt day was ſpent in Skirmiſhes, Picqueering, and other hoſtile Braveries. The next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both Armies impatient of looking upon each other, were drawn out in Battalia with all the advantages that the ground would admit, or able Officers could contrive; the Generals careſſing, exhorting, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging their Souldiers to do well with all
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93173:77"/>their Rhetorick. <hi>Zuiski</hi> fierce in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of his numbers and conduct, told his men, that now was the time to chaſtiſe the hereditary Enemy of their Country, the <hi>Pole,</hi> whoſe malice had been at work to create them thoſe miſchiefs under which their Kingdoms had laboured for divers years: That this was the ſecond mock-<hi>Demetrius,</hi> framed and ſet up in <hi>Poland</hi> to be impoſed upon them: That it would be a reproach to the Glory of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, to receive Laws from Strangers, who by all Arts conſpired their ruine: That this <hi>Demetrius</hi> whom they had now in the head of their Army, was one Maſter <hi>John,</hi> a School-Maſter of <hi>Pocala,</hi> a Town in <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia Alba,</hi> as the other was one <hi>Grisko</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly known in <hi>Muskovy;</hi> and his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death ſuffered in the face of the whole world in <hi>Musko</hi> univerſally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till the wicked <hi>Pole,</hi> maligning their Greatneſs, had raiſed another Impoſtor, under whoſe countenance they propoſed to themſelves the inſlaving of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the rooting out of their Religion: That there was no deliverance from all theſe, and thouſands more of miſeries im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending over them, but in their Courage: That they muſt reſolve to win or die, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93173:78"/>to loſe the day at no other rate than the Ioſs of their lives: That they muſt never ſurvive their own happineſs and the Glory of their Country; and that for his part, he would in that days fight give them the Example of a true lover of it. <hi>Demetrius</hi> on the other ſide, eſpecially <hi>Roſinski,</hi> were not wanting to inflame the courage of their Souldiers by all the Arguments of Power to ſway them; as deſire of Empire, Revenge, and Spoils: That the Conqueſt of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> depended upon the Points of their Swords, and that they had but that days labour to go in and poſſeſs that vaſt Empire. In ſhort, both Armies joyn, with equal hopes and equal courage: The Fight proved but ſhort though obſtinate, and the ſucceſs doubtful, till the <hi>Demetrians</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before-hand placed their Chariots and Carriages; attended with their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, with Drums, Trumpets, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours at a diſtance out of ſight (an uſual <hi>Poliſh</hi> Stratageme) cauſed them in the heat of the Battle to appear in view with cries and ſhoutings; which was ſo dreadful an object to the <hi>Zuiskians,</hi> that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhrink, not daring to truſt in their Courage againſt that freſh Reſerve that advanced towards them: which the <hi>Poliſh</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:93173:78"/>Horſe obſerving, ſeconded their fears with a violent Charge, wherewith they put the whole Army to an entire Rout, leaving behind them all their Cannon and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage upon the place. 5000 of the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kovites</hi> ſaved themſelves in <hi>Bolchow,</hi> who after being four days beleaguered, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves and the Town to the mercy of the Conqueror, and were for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement diſpoſed and liſted amongſt his Troops. The fame of this Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened him a paſſage into all the Cities and Forts in that Quarter, only <hi>Moſaiſe</hi> gave him the trouble of drawing before it, and then ſurrendered. And now <hi>Demetrius</hi> being abſolute Maſter of the Field, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by great Journeys towards <hi>Musko,</hi> the Imperial City; confident, upon the ſtock of his laſt ſignal Victory, that the Citizens upon his approach would quit <hi>Zuiski,</hi> and receive him into their Town: and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs the iſſue had juſtified his compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but for the new perfidy of thoſe 5000 men, who upon the rendition of <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chow</hi> had liſted themſelves under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; for theſe left him again, and marched into <hi>Musko,</hi> aſſuring the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army was neither ſo numerous nor ſo formidable as Fame had
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93173:79"/>rendered them: which comfortable Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Aid giving new life to the heartleſs Citizens, they reſolve to adhere to the Fortunes of <hi>Zuiski;</hi> and taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the delays of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who inſtead of improving his Victory as he ought, ſuffered his men to ramble up and down the Country, they conſented to new Levies for the recruit of their Army, wherewith they blocked up the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and <hi>Severia:</hi> for the <hi>Poles</hi> were moved Northward, ſo that no further Supplies out of the adhering Provinces could well joyn with them; and many who were ignorant of this obſtacle, were daily intercepted. But the <hi>Poles,</hi> at length grown ſenſible of their Error, drew back their Army to the South-ſide of the Town, and having forced thoſe Troops which interrupted their Paſſage, encamped at <hi>Tuſin</hi> with their whole ſtrength, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed and ſecured by the two Rivers <hi>Moska</hi> &amp; <hi>Tuſſin.</hi> From whence by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent &amp; vigorous Excurſions, they obliged the <hi>Muskovites</hi> to keep within their Walls. The Citizens ſeeing themſelves thus ſhut up, and that they could not drive away the Enemy by force, betake themſelves to other ſhifts; they apply themſelves to the <hi>Poliſh</hi>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:93173:79"/>Embaſſadors and the Palatine of <hi>Sandomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and propoſe a Treaty of Peace to them; and in the mean time mention a Ceſſation of Arms, as the only means to compaſs it. Their Deſigne was not ſo much a Reconciliation, as that the <hi>Poles,</hi> otherwiſe naturally careleſs and licentious, ſhould waſte their force and heat in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Truce, and that the deſigned Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours for their relief might be ready againſt the deſigned time. But the Embaſſadors and the Palatine, who had been detained Priſoners ever ſince the Maſſacre, deſirous of Peace and their liberty, ſend <hi>Peter Zba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouski</hi> to the Camp, to perſwade their Countrymen to return into <hi>Poland,</hi> and not diſturb that Peace which they were then treating, with further hoſtilities; but in vain: for the <hi>Poles</hi> refuſed all commerce or mention of Peace, unleſs <hi>Demetrius,</hi> from whom they expected the reward of their labours, were firſt reſtored to his Throne, and the Uſurper delivered into their hands. <hi>Roſinski</hi> was in the interim preparing for an attempt becoming the greatneſs of his Quality and Courage; for Duke <hi>Baſilius Maſalski</hi> a Kinſman of <hi>Zuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki</hi>'s having raiſed an Army in the adjacent Provinces of 70000 men for the relief of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93173:80"/>the Town, had entrenched himſelf upon the Banks of the River <hi>Chodiunka,</hi> three Miles from the City. <hi>Roſinski</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to attempt his Quarters, drew out his whole Army by favour of the night, and marching directly to the Enemies Camp, in a manner ſecure in the greatneſs of their numbers and nearneſs of the City, broke into it without any very great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, killed 14000 upon the place, took the General priſoner, and ſcattered the whole Army. Neither was the Victory cheap or bloodleſs on the <hi>Demetrian</hi> ſide; for while they were engaged upon the Pillage, being diſperſed over the Field to rake up the Spoils, the touted Enemy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced about, and rallying (being further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by a Party come out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) returned to the Charge, and renewing the Fight with much pertinacie, made a ſlaughter amongſt the Conquerors of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of their men; in ſo much that they were upon the point of ſnatching the Victory out of their hands: when the <hi>Poles</hi> armed with deſpair only (for all hopes of flying was gone) ruſhed on with Reſolutions to die or conquer, and finally compelled the <hi>Muskovites</hi> to a diſorderly retreat. This conſiderable Victory mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:93173:80"/>the Reputation and Terror of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> his Arms. Many Provinces ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, and he was reinforced with many and great Supplies out of <hi>Poland. Alexander Zlarowski</hi> brought him an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of 1500 Horſe, <hi>Sapiha</hi> as many, and ſeveral others other great Troops; in ſo much that the <hi>Muskovites</hi> (their own Forces being waſted, and ſuch ſwarms of Foreiners pouring in upon them) deſpaired of being able to repel them: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore betake themſelves to new Counſels, and coming to terms with the Embaſſadors of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Palatine, ſtill in their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, they gave them their liberty, upon their undertaking to oblige their King to remand the Army of his Subjects w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> lay then at their doors: whereupon they, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the unfortunate <hi>Marina</hi> in their company, were permitted to depart. <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> having intelligence of this, and not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how advantageous it would be to his Cauſe to have theſe Perſons with him; he ſent <hi>Zbarowski</hi> with 2000 Horſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept their paſſage; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he did without difficulty, bringing them to the Camp, where they were preſented to <hi>Demetrius.</hi> But his Party was much out of countenance to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that ſtrangeneſs of <hi>Marina's</hi> carriage
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93173:81"/>towards him, with that of her Father and the Embaſſadors, all of them affirming that this <hi>Demetrius</hi> differed very much from the ſlain Great Duke. But this paſſage was huſht up with all poſſible care and caution, and ſhe ſent to another Quarter of the Camp, no notice being taken that <hi>Demetrius</hi> had yet ſeen her; but this could not be ſo carried as to eſcape every obſervation: but what was moſt ſenſible was, that <hi>Knia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Maſalski,</hi> the routed Generals Kinſman, then a priſoner in the Camp, made his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape; and getting into the Town, told the <hi>Muskovites</hi> the whole Story of <hi>Marina's</hi> arrival and doubts; which wrought ſo powerfully upon the waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, that they made new Vows of Allegeance and Fidelity to <hi>Zuiski;</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolved to ſuffer any hardſhip rather than this ſecond Impoſture, or to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon at the will of their Enemies. And therefore to teſtifie the fallacious dealing of their Adverſaries to the whole world, and to ſatisfie all others as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they did by the inſtigation of <hi>Zuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki,</hi> depute ſome perſons of Honour in principal eſteem amongſt them, to repair to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>glecz,</hi> with Orders to diſinter the body of the true <hi>Demetrius,</hi> which had lain there
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93173:81"/>15 years, and to convey it to <hi>Musko,</hi> to be depoſited in the Sepulchre of his Fathers. The Body was ſcarce above ground, when it was cunningly inſinuated into the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the touch of it did work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous effects, which had been experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the fortuitous touch of ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed Patients. The Veneration towards it was heightened by the Peoples aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the uncorruptedneſs of the Corps (for it was found ſtill entire) which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it blaſphemous to queſtion what was become an Article of their Faith, to wit, whether this was the true, or the other the falſe <hi>Demetrius.</hi> Many lame and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned blind by their interceſſions to this new Saint were reſtored to their vigour and ſight: ſo that the ſenſeleſs Corps, by the importunities of the more ſenceleſs Vulgar, was ordered to remain uninterred, until a Temple were built for its repoſe and their Superſtition. A while after, the buſineſs grew ſo abſurdly publick, that the Relicks of this fictitious Deity were by <hi>Zuiski</hi>'s command, leſt the fallacie ſhould be diſcovered, ſuddenly, but very ſolemnly inhumed; this Reaſon being given, that though all manner of Honour was due to the Sacred Memory of their Prince, yet
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93173:82"/>that Cult and that Veneration might by the miſtaken zeal of the people be paid to a Mortal Creature, which is only due to the Immortal Creator; and ſo rendered them all in tangled in the ſame error, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Divine Indignation.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Camp, where we left the unſatisfied <hi>Marina,</hi> whoſe Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had expoſed her to extraordinary turns of Fortune; and that being ſtill the predominant paſſion of her Soul, when ſhe was retired from <hi>Demetrius</hi> to an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment prepared for her and her Father, ſhe had better leaſure to digeſt and weigh the poſture of her Affairs; and conſulting the matter with her Father and ſome of their moſt ſecret Confidents, they brought it to this, that ſhe muſt either own this <hi>Demetrius,</hi> or return into her Country with all the diſreputation and reproaches that could be invented by either Party. The <hi>Zuiskians</hi> would affirm ſhe had married a mean wretch, a ſuborned property, a Muſhrome ſtarted out of the earth, and as ſoon extinct: and <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents would give out, that ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his Wife, but that he had repudiated her for Incontinencie. On the other ſide, if ſhe ſhould receive this man as her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93173:82"/>
               <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſhe was ſure to caſt her ſelf into the arms of ſome ignoble ſordid perſon, ſet up only to gratifie the Intereſts of the <hi>Poles,</hi> and ſhe muſt thus proſtitute her ſelf as it were to ſerve their ends. But then after a full conſultation they came to this, that by owning this ſecond Impoſtor (if the firſt were one) ſhe ſhould ſit upon the Throne of <hi>Muskovy;</hi> and that how ungenerous or mean ſoever <hi>Demetrius</hi> were in the reality of his extraction, the Crown (as it cures and wipes off all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainders) would Nobilitate and purifie his Blood; and that in truth Nobility it ſelf was no other than a continued Succeſſion of Greatneſs beyond the memory of the preſent times, there being no eſſential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in the Extractions, but what is made by Wealth and Education. Theſe whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome conſiderations being received by this wiſe Lady, ſhe reſolved to ſubmit to the condition of the times, and to ſerve her ſelf of this opportunity to aſcend to the Throne of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> which ſhe had but ſeen as it were before like a Scene in a Play. But now ſhe propoſed to her ſelf, that this <hi>Demetrius</hi> being upon the point of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Musko</hi> it ſelf, and bringing the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to a greater ſubjection than they had
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93173:83"/>formerly been, ſhe hoped her Dominion would be longer-lived, as laid upon Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of greater Policie. So that after ten days ſeparation (upon ſeveral preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of indiſpoſition) ſhe ſuffered her ſelf to be conducted to the arms of her <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> as ſhe call'd him. The buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Deſigne of a popular nature, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to be acted in the face of the whole World; in order whereto, <hi>Demetrius</hi> was to meet his Empreſs in the preſence of the whole Army, when all the Nobility, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of forein Princes, and Deputies of revolted Provinces were upon the place. The Enterview was ſolemn, and full of paſſion. <hi>Demetrius</hi> received <hi>Marina</hi> into his arms, and intermingling their tears with their embraces, the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was acted ſo to the life, that the moſt ſubtle and doubting obſervers could not refuſe to be ſatisfied. The Lady mingled the teſtimony of her love with marks of eſteem and reverence as to her Lord as well as Huſband; and he repeated his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces and endearments with ſo vive a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that they drew tears of joy from the Beholders. He was not wanting in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application to the Palatine, making him his acknowledgments for all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93173:83"/>he had received from him in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie of his Affairs; and they failed not to mention ſome particular paſſages of that time, which both of them ſeemed to remember very well, and with much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. This Ceremony being performed with all neceſſary circumſtances, the moſt wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſeemed now confirmed of the reality of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and came flocking to the Camp from all Quarters. And thus did this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, contrary to the nature of Untruths, gain ground by age. In the mean time it was judged needful to fortifie and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the Camp, as well againſt the approaching Winter, as the attempts of the Enemy. Several goodly Edifices were erected for the Nobility, and Tents and Huts prepared for the reſt of the Army; ſo that the whole being divided into Streets and publike places, had the reſemblance of a great City. All the Provinces of the Empire except <hi>Novogrodock</hi> and <hi>Smolensko</hi> made their ſubmiſſions to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying his Camp with abundance of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of all ſorts. The Inhabitants of <hi>Musko</hi> being by the defection of the Country and the ill neighbourhood of the Camp reduced to great ſtraights, yet had courage enough not to yield, but applied
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93173:84"/>themſelves to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who having uſurped the Crown upon his Nephew <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> was glad of any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to incommode him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent them a conſiderable force under the Command of <hi>Pontus de la Guarde,</hi> which gave them a ſtrong diverſion the Summer following; and many Provinces of the Empire being tired and exhauſted by intolerable Contributions exacted from them by the <hi>Poles,</hi> grew to a deteſtation of them; which having rendred the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of that vaſt Country univerſal, the Camp it ſelf was not without ſtrong effects of them, by Schiſm and Diſſention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Great Ones, whereby many opportunities of well-doing were omitted and neglected. Hence aroſe a new face of Affairs, and prodigious Viciſſitudes; for all things ſeeming to conſpire againſt the Impoſture of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> fatally oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, even in the moment that in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane appearance he ſhould have trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed over all his Enemies.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things are thus moving in <hi>Muskovy, Sigiſmund</hi> the Third King of <hi>Poland</hi> was induced by the perſwaſions of his Senate and Council to invade that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Empire: and to what was objected
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93173:84"/>that there was a Truce in being, the time of it not yet expired; it was anſwered, that this was no Violation of that, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an adhering to it, by appearing for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> the lawful Great Duke, and in actual poſſeſſion of the greateſt part of the Empire, againſt an Uſurper, who had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf to be elected by perfidie and force. This would acquit them as to the world; and then as to that thing, it was very adviſable with relation to the preſent poſture of their Affairs. Their civil Diſſentions were but newly calmed; and if any ſeeds of them remained, this would be a means to root them up, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the humour upon another Enemy, and burying in Oblivion the former heats and animoſities among themſelves, by a nobler War abroad. It would alſo purge their Country of thoſe ſwarms of vagrant Fellows and Robbers which now infeſted it, being the Excrements of their unhappy Diſcords; and to all this 'twas urged, that this War carried no charge with it: The Army was ready upon the leaſt Summons, and would be able without difficulty to march into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> where they ſhould live upon the Country as ſoon as they ſhould ſet foot in it. There were many other
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93173:85"/>Arguments of Honour and Intereſt, as to revenge the Maſſacre of their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the detention of their Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and the employing ſo powerful a Neighbour at his own home and charges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which being laid together, it was determined to invade <hi>Muskovy</hi> with a Royal Army, and the King in the Head of it, where he could not in a divided &amp; diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed State fail to give Law to both Parties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> in order to this Deſigne mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered his Army at <hi>Orſa,</hi> which conſiſted of 6000 Lances, 18000 light-Horſe, and 5000 foot; and paſſing the River <hi>Boriſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> entred <hi>Muskovy</hi> in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1609. <hi>Leo Sapiha</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the King that if he but appeared before <hi>Smolensko</hi> the place would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſurrendred into his hands This Temptation put him upon a haſty March, taking with him neither Cannon nor any other Engines of Battery, going rather to receive than force a City ſtored with all manner of Proviſions neceſſary for War. But having by long Marches got near the Town, he found himſelf very much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his computation, the Garriſon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtrong Sallies upon him; which look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo unlike a Surrender, that he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93173:85"/>himſelf deceived in his Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Sehin</hi> Palatine and Governour of the place had 30000 Souldiers with him beſides the Townſmen, being as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more able to bear Arms, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe quantity of Ammunition, Artillery, and Proviſions to ſerve for a long Siege: ſo that the Palatine upon a confidence of his ſtrength, deſpiſed the Chancellors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation for a Surrender. The King then ſeeing there was no entrance to be had unleſs forced, ſate down before it, fancying that a ſhort time would reduce ſo great a multitude to diſtreſs, however plentifully provided at preſent; being reſtrained from forraging, or the Country from bringing in their Proviſions: or at worſt, that they might be forced in a few Months, by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Attack. With theſe hopes he lays ſiege to the Place; which did not end ſo, for it held out above two years, with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous changes and toils on both ſides. <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko</hi> the Metropolis of a Province of that name, is famous for its largeneſs, wealth, and beauty; and being ſeated on the Banks of the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> is encompaſſed with Hills and vaſt Woods. The Walls of the City are eight cubits thick, and 35 in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93173:86"/>height, whereof 15 are of free-ſtone, and the other 20 of Brick, built after the old faſhion, as alſo without Ditches or Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works to hinder Approaches. <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> conſidering the obſtinacie and power of the Enemy, commanded Cannon for Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Spades, Mattocks, and all other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for a Siege, to be brought him from <hi>Vilna</hi> and <hi>Ticcocino,</hi> whileſt he ſhuts up the Paſſages and Avenues of the City with his Quarters and Circumvallation. The King himſelf lay on <hi>Orſa</hi> ſide, his Quarters extending to the Banks of the <hi>Boriſthenes;</hi> the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> kept the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, reaching that way to the ſame River: <hi>Potocki</hi> Palatine of <hi>Bracl</hi> had his Poſt on the North-ſide beyond the River; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving burnt a Village near the City, which lay convenient for them to fetch in their ſupplies of Water, gave them ſome diſtreſs that way. <hi>Nowodorski</hi> a Knight of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and Captain of the Kings Guards, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered himſelf famous for an Attempt, wherein if he had been vigorouſly ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the place had run the riſk of falling into the Kings hands. He faſtened a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard to St. <hi>Michaels</hi> Gate, which laid the paſſage open into the Town; but being ill ſeconded by his own men, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93173:86"/>multitudes of the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> flocking to the danger, he was forced to retreat without having effected any thing more, than to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Enemy more diligent: who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately blocked up their Gates with Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of earth, making alſo great Trenches before them, to prevent the like Attempt for the future. And thus the Siege continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with various labours on both ſides; the King having lain about a year before it with more pertinacie than was judged conducible to the ſtate of his Affairs, which ſeemed to invite him to <hi>Musko</hi> the Imperial Seat, as a place more probable to fall into his hands.</p>
            <p>It was now the Year 1610, and the <hi>Zuiskians</hi> had laboured long againſt a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Enemy at their Doors, when the Aids came from <hi>Sweden.</hi> The <hi>Poles</hi> in the Camp wanted not their inconveniencies: They had a multitude of Chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which occaſioned frequent Diſputes, to the diſappointing of many probable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes; they had to this a licentiouſneſs in their Diſcipline, ſecure careleſneſs in the conduct of their Affairs (the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of that Nation) and an inſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and irreſolution in their Councils, all things ſeeming to portend their ruine.:
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93173:87"/>Moſt of the great Cities and Provinces, except <hi>Severia,</hi> had revolted from their Obedience: Their Taxations were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come intolerable, which the unſeaſonable Seditions of the Army had extorted from <hi>Demetrius</hi> for want of Pay; the People now too late repenting themſelves of the Contributions already paid them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they muſt have left them to the enjoyment of that peace, which by their own folly and fickle nature they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived themſelves of. They proceeded ſo far in many parts of the Empire, as to ſeize upon, impriſon, and kill the Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherers; which cauſed the <hi>Poles</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe ſtrong Parties of their Army into ſeveral parts of the Land, inſomuch that their force in the Camp did not ſuffice to check the excurſions of the Town, by whom they were ſeveral times baffled. Their Commander in Chief <hi>Roſinski</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of thoſe Sallies was ſhot into the ſide with an Arrow, of which hurt he lay long ſick, and never perfectly recovered. Upon an Encounter which happened in <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Poles</hi> had gained a notable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over them; but delaying their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, gave the Enemy time to come on with freſh Troops againſt their wearied
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93173:87"/>Souldiers, whom they routed; and ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Victory out of their hands, took divers Priſoners, and deſtroyed moſt of their Foot. The time was thus waſted, as well as the ſtrength of each Party. The <hi>Poles</hi> having received Intelligence of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Aids towards <hi>Musko</hi> under the Command of <hi>Pontus de la Garde,</hi> ſent <hi>Alexander Zbarowski</hi> with 2000 Horſe to check their progreſs. He beat one of their Regiments at <hi>Toccinum,</hi> and killed 600 <hi>Germans</hi> upon the place. The <hi>Muskovites</hi> concerned in the ſafety of theſe Auxiliaries, drew out their whole ſtrength and joyned with them. The <hi>Poles</hi> alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced <hi>Zbarowski</hi> with their beſt Troops; and being now in the Field again, both Armies met at <hi>Twer,</hi> 30 Leagues from <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko:</hi> the Diſpute was fierce, the <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ruſhing with contempt upon thoſe they had ſo often beaten; &amp; the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> ſeemed more willing to die than be overcome; which made the Fight bloody and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, until theſe were forced yet again to give place to the Aſcendant Virtue of the <hi>Poles.</hi> And certainly the buſineſs had there received an end, had not the main body of the Army, commanded by <hi>Zba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowski</hi> himſelf, ſhrunk from the ground:
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93173:88"/>for both his Wings prevailed over thoſe of the Enemy, and diſperſed thoſe who had beaten his Battalia; but their number being inferior to that of the Enemy, they durſt not follow the purſuit, or attack the body of Foot, which ſtood immoveable, notwithſtanding the defection of their Horſe. There were ſlain in this Fight 1000 <hi>German</hi> Horſe, and 6000 <hi>Musko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> with the loſs of but 50 <hi>Poles.</hi> The Main Body of <hi>Zbarowski</hi>'s Army emulous of the Succeſs of their Fellows, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſhame of their own miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, reſolved upon the very ſpot of ground to redeem their ſullied Honour, though contrary to the advice of ſome of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt Souldiers, who counſelled them to withdraw to a more advantageous Poſt. The Army labouring thus under divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Counſels, but united in a careleſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, ſome lying in the Field, and others quartered in the Town: The rallied Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my about break of day fell upon them with a ſurprize ſo violent, that they had no choice left them, but to fly for their lives, or lie by it. Many ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>Twer,</hi> which was Garriſon'd with <hi>Coſſacks;</hi> others ſcarce looked till they got to the Camp at <hi>Musko.</hi> The <hi>Poles</hi> did
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93173:88"/>indeed what they could to have rallied, but the Aſſault being univerſal, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to do it; which probably ſaved moſt of them; but they loſt all their Baggage, and moſt of their Horſes. The <hi>Muskovites</hi> raiſed upon the ſtock of this Victory, ſtormed the Caſtle of <hi>Twer</hi> thrice, but were as oft beaten off with loſs; and now deſpairing of carrying the place, they raiſed the Siege, and marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Volga,</hi> where they met again with the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Forces, and fought them at <hi>Kolaſinum,</hi> but parted upon equal terms.</p>
            <p>Whileſt <hi>Zuiski</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> do thus with various Fortune ſtrive for the Empire of <hi>Ruſſia, Sigiſmund</hi> continues obſtinate at the Siege of <hi>Smolensko;</hi> which if he had raiſed, and transferred his Arms to <hi>Musko,</hi> it is very probable he might have given Law to both thoſe wearied and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parties: but he was abſolutely reſolved not to quit the place till he had taken it, though it may be preſumed he failed in his unſeaſonable diſtracting and weakning the <hi>Demetrian Poles,</hi> which he ought rather to have aſſiſted with freſh Supplies, leſt the <hi>Muskoviters</hi> prevailing, <hi>Zuiski</hi> might be confirmed in the Government, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93173:89"/>the relief of <hi>Smolensko</hi> with the united Forces of the Empire; which alſo happened. The King had not his Recruits ſo opportunely out of <hi>Poland</hi> as he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but he could not well call his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen from <hi>Demetrius</hi> without ſatisfying their Arrears, and the rewards they had propoſed from the Victory they ſeemed aſſured of; and the exhauſted Treaſury of the Commonwealth could not ſuffice for ſuch a ſum: but he poſitive in his reſolves, ſent ſome eminent Emiſſaries to perſwade them to abandon <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and return to their Duty. They on the other ſide, ſent their Embaſſadors to the King, that they might not by an untimely deſertion be defrauded of the fruit of their labours: and after many altercations and diſputes of Duty and Rewards, the Souldiery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to perſevere in their faith to <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> and which they were obliged to by the Sacred Ties of Vows and Oaths. There were, for all that, ſome who promiſed O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, provided they might be paid their Arrears due to them from <hi>Demetrius.</hi> But the Kings wiſeſt Counſellors judged that they ought ſtill to keep in with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> and by no means to diſtract his Forces until <hi>Smolensko</hi> were taken: for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93173:89"/>then they might march to <hi>Musko</hi> without oppoſition; with aſſurance, that all the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Forces, and all the places poſſeſſed by them, would of courſe fall into their hands. It was certain, that every diſgrace that happened to <hi>Demetrius</hi> would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage <hi>Zuiski:</hi> for the City of <hi>Musko</hi> would not only be delivered by diſperſing his Army, but all the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Provinces revolt alſo from him; which proved true, as will appear hereafter: For the Kings Agents having at length gained <hi>Roſinski, Zlarowski,</hi> and ſome other Chief Officers, the reſt began to waver; which did ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that being ſollicitous for his own ſecurity, looking now upon the Kings Engagement as a Deſigne to expoſe him, he reſolved to withdraw, rather than be made a Sacrifice either to his Intereſt, or the Avarice of the Souldiery, who for the ſatisfaction of their Arrears, would (he thought) have delivered him up to <hi>Zuiski</hi> himſelf. He would however firſt ſpeak with <hi>Roſinski,</hi> and endeavour to conſerve him if poſſible, ſtill; but to no purpoſe: which irritated him ſo much, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him with levity and breach of Truſt. This enraged <hi>Roſinski</hi> to that height, that he dared to call the Emperour
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93173:90"/>to his face an Impoſtor, and the Son of a Whore. Theſe Speeches not to be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a private man, did ſo diſturb the Prince, that ſeeing himſelf not in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to revenge them, or indeed to ſecure his own Perſon in his own Camp, he reſolved to leave it; and taking Horſe with only a very few of his Friends to Guard him, he privately got away, and fled to <hi>Caluga</hi> All the <hi>Boyarian Muskovites</hi> of his party did follow him; and his Lady, however left in the Camp, would not ſtay behind. The Embaſſadors endeavoured to detain her, and to perſwade her return into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but ſhe, like another <hi>Texena,</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhe had not only wedded the good Fortunes of her Huſband, but his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities alſo. The Embaſſadors did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding perſiſt and earneſtly preſs her to ſubmit her ſelf to the Kings Clemencie and Munificence. They did at length ſo much, that ſhe ſeemed vanquiſhed by their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, promiſing ſhe would ſend Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of her own to the King; and gave them for the preſent her Letters to his Majeſty, wherein having congratulated his arrival in <hi>Muskovy,</hi> ſhe wiſhed him all good Succeſs. She farther complained o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I relinquiſh all to your Majeſties diſpoſal, being aſſured of your Equity and Juſtice; only I beg, that you will treat me and my Family (who will be no ſmall ſupport to you in the acquiſition of the <hi>Muskovitiſh</hi> Empire) according to our Dignity and your Magnificence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demetrius</hi> his flight being known, the whole Camp was in an alarm and tumult. Some would follow the Great Duke, ſome would go to the King, and others would continue in their Quarters till they had their Arrears. The Complaints againſt <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinski</hi> were high and furious, by whoſe arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice &amp; wickedneſs, they ſaid <hi>Demetrius</hi> had been forced to quit the Camp, whereby the Souldiers ſhould be deprived of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their Blood &amp; Labours. <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Letters read publikely did extremely foment their Seditions, but the preſence and carriage of <hi>Marina</hi> tranſported them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93173:91"/>all bounds. She with a Courage more than Maſculine, and a Countenance compoſed of ſorrow and ſweetneſs, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered through the Camp, ſpoke to all ſhe met, called ſuch as ſhe knew by their names, and urged thoſe ſhe did not, by the Charms of her looks and preſence; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, ſhe inflamed all with her winning Diſcourſes. She tells them, that their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Courages were to expect their Stipend and Reward of ſo many Travels from <hi>Demetrius</hi> only, it not being likely that the King would remunerate the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they had done for others otherwiſe than with ſcorn and contumely. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates to them the infinite Treaſures of <hi>Muskovy,</hi> and the Greatneſs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and aſſures them that the Great Duke would deny them nothing by whoſe fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and fortitude he ſhould be reſtored to what had been ſo cruelly uſurped from him. The Souldiery being incenſed with theſe and the like Diſcourſes, the <hi>Dumenſian Coſſacks</hi> immediately leave the the Camp to follow the fortunes of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius. Roſinski</hi> would hinder them; but they perſiſting, endeavoured to break through the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe in their way They fought, and two thouſand fell i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:93173:91"/>that Conflict on both ſides. After this Fight, ſome ran into the City, and ſome went to <hi>Demetrius</hi> to <hi>Caluga,</hi> and the reſt remained with their Chieftain <hi>Zarucki</hi> in the Camp. Some days after happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother more grievous, but leſs bloody Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, begun by the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe, and which threatned all with ruine. The Cauſe of this Tumult was <hi>Marina's</hi> flight, who when ſhe had effected what ſhe could with the Souldiers, omitting nothing to reconcile them to her own and her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Intereſt, and now ſecure of a great part of the Army, ſhe diſguiſed her ſelf in mans Apparel, and accompanied only with one Maid and a few <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> came ſafe to <hi>Caluga.</hi> Before ſhe parted, ſhe wrote a Letter to the Army, which ſhe left upon her Table in her Chamber, wherein ſhe tells them, that ſhe was forced to retire from amongſt them, to ſave her Honour, her Fame, and her Life. She could ſuffer no longer the faſt and opprobrious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of that inſolent and drunken fellow (meaning <hi>Roſinski.</hi>) She invoked God, the Avenger of wrongs; minds the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Religion of their Vows: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs againſt the flagitious perfidy of her Adverſaries; and finally, extolling the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93173:92"/>and Courage of her Friends, bids them not only hope for, but aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all they could wiſh for from the Great Duke, as ſoon as he had recovered his Empire. The laſt word of the Letter was, <hi>I part.</hi> This Epiſtle being read, was like the ſounding of an Alarm, all being full of tumult and horror. The Souldiers ran to their Arms, and in threatning Troops haſte to the Generals Tent, crying out, Is it ſo <hi>Roſinski,</hi> that by thy Pride and Debaucheries thou didſt force the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured <hi>Marina</hi> to follow her baniſhed Lord? What Captains ſhall we now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? Thee perfide, and betrayer of the Souldiery, who being bought and deluded by the vain promiſes of the Kings Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wouldſt deceive us of our Stipend, and the rewards of our Labours; Reſtore to us our Princes, and try thou firſt that butchery thou doſt prepare for us. And therewith they made ſeveral ſhot with their Piſtols at him; but he eſcaped that danger, though he could not appeaſe the tumult; neither would they any more be Commanded by him, but chuſing one <hi>Tiskevicius</hi> for their General, prepare to follow <hi>Demetrius</hi> their old Lord. For all this, the Chief Officers, and thoſe moſt in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93173:92"/>favour with the Souldiery, had by their diligence and Authority welnigh appeaſed theſe diſorders; which they had alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably effected, if new Commotions had not interven'd, upon new conſiderations, to wit, that it was not ſafe to remain longer in the Camp ſo diſtracted and divided, without Order or Diſcipline, and in ſight of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy vigilant and intent upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. This hurried them into new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, and like ſo many Furies they all cry out they would immediately be gone; and packing up their Baggage, fired their Camp, which for the variety and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of its Structures ſeemed another great City; and being ready to march, mutually engaged to keep together till they came to <hi>Volock,</hi> where every body ſhould be at liberty to diſpoſe of himſelf as he thought moſt for his advantage. Being come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Sapiha</hi> and all his men reſolving to follow the fortune of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> went to <hi>Caluga</hi> to him. <hi>Roſinski</hi> and <hi>Alexander Zbarowski</hi> with 4000 Horſe and the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſian Coſſacks,</hi> went to their King at <hi>Smolensko.</hi> And thus this power which had ſo long blocked up <hi>Musko,</hi> and had trampled upon the Empire two years, and would certainly have ſubjugated both,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93173:93"/>was diſperſed in the beginning of <hi>March</hi> 1610, by the ill Counſel, and to the very great detriment of King <hi>Sigiſmund;</hi> for the Enemy being well-nigh broke with the long Siege of their Metropolitan, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered new force and vigour upon the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it; and the King, who might have proſecuted the War at the expence and danger of others, drew the whole burthen of it, as it were, voluntarily upon his own ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Zuiskian Musko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> not ignorant of the diſſentions in the Camp, began to hope well; but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to their diſcords, leſt by attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the ſenſe of their common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger might unite them, they turned their forces another way. They turned the <hi>Poles</hi> out of <hi>Peraſlaw</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> which lay there; drive <hi>Sapiha</hi> from the Siege of <hi>Troyeze,</hi> and reduced all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces about the <hi>Volga</hi> into their power. But when the City it ſelf was delivered from their troubleſome Neighbours, then, as if they had broken their Fetters, &amp; been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of a long Impriſonment, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed new courage and new vigour; and having in a ſhort time recovered moſt of the Provinces which revolted to them,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93173:93"/>they ſent the beſt part of their Army to follow <hi>Roſinski,</hi> who had poſſeſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of <hi>Volock</hi> and the ſtrong Monaſtery of <hi>Oſippow.</hi> He was neceſſitated to ſtay there, by reaſon of the indiſpoſition his hurts had procured him. He kept with him 1500 <hi>Poles</hi> and 400 <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> having ſent the reſt of the Army with <hi>Zbarowski</hi> to the King. His health was much impaired, through his daily toils and the ſmart of his old hurt; to which alſo contributed the perturbation and grief of his mind, which his ill Succeſſes had created him, in that he had quitted <hi>Musko</hi> with leſs Glory and Splendor than he had attempted it. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſtrength being decayed in him, he was overcome by the violence of his Malady; and unable to reſiſt longer, was forced to ſubmit to the neceſſity of his Fate, which deprived him of his life and hopes in a ſtrange Country, which he had entred in Pomp and Triumph.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roſinski</hi> being dead, <hi>Volviovius</hi> the <hi>Zuiskian</hi> General taking the occaſion of the diſtraction his loſs had bred amongſt the Garriſon, beſieged <hi>Volock,</hi> and took it without much difficulty. <hi>Oſſipow</hi> defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf better, in ſo much that the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries from <hi>Sweden,</hi> being <hi>French,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93173:94"/>to ſhew of what importance they were to their Party, having opened a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into the Fortreſs with a Petard, were after a very bloody Aſſault baffled and beaten off. But the place being more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by wants from within, than by any force from the Enemy from without, were forced to yield to the neceſſity of their condition; but ſcorning a tame ſurrender, they reſolved upon a Salley, and to take the hazard of that as their ſafeſt and laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. The obſcurity of the night was judged fitteſt for the Exployt; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, they refreſhed themſelves with the whole Proviſions of the place, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mutual embracings and encouragement of each other, they ſet open their Gates, and made towards <hi>Smolensko.</hi> Their Sally was furious, like that of men reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to die, and they performed it with a Courage hurried on by deſpair, which made the Fight bloody, and the carnage great amongſt the <hi>Muskovites;</hi> but they abounding in their numbers, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurprized upon this occaſion, killed moſt of the <hi>Poles,</hi> ſo that ſcarce 300 of them eſcaped in ſafety (and they were 1200 who ſallied out) to <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s Camp.</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:93173:94"/>
            <p>The <hi>Muskovites</hi> raiſed with this variety of Succeſſes, formed to themſelves an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of 30000 men, to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were added 1000 <hi>French, De la Garde's Germans,</hi> and 6000 <hi>Suedes</hi> newly arrived under the Command of Count <hi>Edward Horn. Demetrius</hi> after his quitting the Camp lay with a few <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pihans</hi> at <hi>Caluga;</hi> but they deſpiſing his ſmall force, marched to the relief of <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko.</hi> King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe preparations and their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, Commanded <hi>Staniſlaws Zolkie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> his General with 8000 choice men to obſtruct their paſſage. The two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies engaged at <hi>Cluſinum,</hi> where the <hi>Muskovites</hi> were again overcome by the Fatal Virtue of the <hi>Poles,</hi> in a great and memorable Battle. But it coſt the <hi>Poles</hi> dear: for though their Right Wing had routed the Enemies Left, Commanded by <hi>Demetrius Zuiski</hi> the Great Dukes Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet the other Wing, conſiſting of <hi>Germans</hi> and other Strangers, ſtood their ground, which they had choſen advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly amongſt ſhrubs and other rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, in ſuch a place where the Enemies Horſe could not come up to charge them without much difficulty; but being well ſeconded by their Reſerves, they at laſt made ſo violent an impreſſion upon this
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93173:95"/>Wing alſo, that it was put to flight. There remained yet the Main Body of Foot, made up of <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Swedes,</hi> which kept entire; and the <hi>Poliſh</hi> being recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the purſuit, prepared to make a Charge upon them; but they ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abandoned by their Horſe, and left ſingly to the fortune of the day, many of their men likewiſe ſtealing from them and running to the Enemy, durſt not ſtand out the ſhock, but waved their Hats and hands about their Heads in ſigne of Parley; which being granted, and Hoſtages deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, they ſurrendered themſelves, for all what <hi>la Guarde</hi> (who was newly returned from the flight, whileſt they were in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) could intreat or do to the contrary. Thoſe Wings that had been defeated, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rallied themſelves, returned alſo to their Station, upon a confidence their Foot had ſtood their ground; but they came only time enough to be beaten over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the <hi>Poles</hi> having the purſuit of them till late in the night: and thus the Field being cleared of the Enemy, they had the entire Pillage of it, with all their Cannon and Baggage. The <hi>Germans,</hi> a Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Soldateſque, took pay in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; the reſt of the Captives, the Colours,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93173:95"/>and other Enſignes of Victory, were ſent to the King at <hi>Smolensko;</hi> who ſhewed them to the Beſieged with what Military Pomp and Oſtentation they could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, who were alſo invited to a Surrender after ſo ſignal and irrecoverable a loſs; but to no purpoſe: for <hi>Sehin</hi> being of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid Courage, as if he alone would ſtay the declining fate of his Country, did dare ſingly to reſiſt the courſe of ſo many Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. <hi>Volviovius</hi> lay at <hi>Czarow</hi> with a Party of 8000 <hi>Zuis kians,</hi> but terrified with this Succeſs, did upon the firſt Summons render himſelf and his Army to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors diſcretion, <hi>Czarow</hi> being taken, the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army marched towards <hi>Musko,</hi> whither the <hi>Sapihans,</hi> having routed the <hi>Zuiskian Tartars</hi> at <hi>Troycze,</hi> and a thouſand <hi>Muskovites</hi> at <hi>Borowsko,</hi> did alſo haſten. The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> broken with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny evils, being vanquiſhed at <hi>Cluſinum,</hi> at <hi>Troycze,</hi> and at <hi>Borowsko,</hi> and ſeeing the <hi>Poles</hi> approached their City, and that the <hi>Demetrians</hi> did meditate a new Siege; and finally, being the <hi>Germans</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted to the Enemy, and that there was no appearance of repairing their ruined Troops, did not know to what Saint to devote themſelves, or how to extricate
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93173:96"/>themſelves out of ſo many impending mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. At length, after many and various agitations and conſultations, they fix upon an expedient of a very extraordinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their deliverance. In the firſt place they ſeize upon and depoſe their Great Duke <hi>Baſilius Zuiski,</hi> as the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Author of all their miſcarriages, and infamous for his Misfortunes, his Tyranny, and his Sorceries, with which they charged him; and with a paſſion equal with that wherewith they had raiſed him to the Throne, they pulled him down again, and thruſt him into a Cloyſter; giving at the ſame time out, that they would elect <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaws,</hi> King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s Son, Great Duke in his ſtead: propoſing by this means that they ſhould quit their hands of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> whom they equally ſcorned and hated; take away the cauſe of the War in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and compoſe their harraſſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with ſuch a Government, that would immediately reſcue them from all other pretenſions. They knew the <hi>Poles</hi> (whom they naturally hated like emulous Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) would become ſecure by this Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that they themſelves having breathed a while, and quit themſelves of the War, ſhould be able either to elude
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93173:96"/>the Election of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaws,</hi> or remove him as obnoxious to their Artifices, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Childhood, in due time. They then propoſed to themſelves the choice of a Prince of their own Blood and Manners, and the reverting of their Government into its antient Channel: all which hapned as they did deſigne, and their Counſels laid upon profound Reaſons of State, had a Succeſs accordingly. The <hi>Poles</hi> ſway'd by a nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Intereſt than that of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> had no care of recruiting his Party, but on the contrary prepared for the reinforcing of the City of <hi>Musko</hi> againſt his Attempts; in order whereunto (upon this bare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of chuſing <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaws</hi> for their Great Duke) <hi>Zalkievius</hi> ſent Troops to their Aid to defend them againſt <hi>Demetrius;</hi> and following himſelf with the whole Army, he ſate down on the Eaſt-ſide of the City (<hi>Demetrius</hi> his Camp being on the other) and a while after the Gates being ſet open for him, he marched through the City, and encamped with all his forces near <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> his Camp. It was no hard matter for <hi>Zolkievius</hi> to debauch the <hi>Sapihans,</hi> upon his engagement for the Publike Faith of the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi> to be given them for their Arrears; ſo that they revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93173:97"/>unanimouſly to him. <hi>Demetrius</hi> thus forſaken by them he confided moſt in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated again to <hi>Caluga</hi> as an auſpicious place, for the ſhelter he had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived there. His moſt faithful Friends, as if they had been obliged to his Fortune, not to him, did in this diſaſtrous juncture of his Affairs expoſe him to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. <hi>Zarucki</hi> that courageous Leader of the <hi>Dunenſian Coſſacks,</hi> with <hi>Kaſinowski</hi> Prince of <hi>Tartary,</hi> his greateſt Confidents, did likewiſe leave him for a time, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves with the reſt to the will of the Conquereror. The <hi>Muskovites</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from <hi>Demetrius,</hi> would have reſpited the Election of their new Duke, but that there was no other choice now left them. They had an Army in their Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, reſolved not to quit the City till they ſaw their Prince ſeated upon the Throne. They therefore proceeded to the Election according to the uſual Ceremonies, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, though abſent, to be Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Fealty ſworn to him as Great Duke and Emperour, hiding all their ſecret averſions under the Maſk of Joy and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations: and that they might remove all ſhadow of ſuſpition from themſelves, they delivered the unfortunate <hi>Baſilius Zuiski,</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:93173:97"/>with his Brethren <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> into <hi>Zolkievius</hi> his hands; who alſo engaged, as likewiſe the great Officers of his Army, to the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> that the new Duke ſhould ſpeedily come to them, conſerve their Religion inviolable, and maintain all the Priviledges of the Nobility and People. And thus was the Government upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tranſlated into new hands.</p>

               <hi>Z<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iski</hi> being thus laid aſide, and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaws</hi> choſen in his place, there was a ſplendid Embaſſy ſent to King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> ſtill before <hi>Smolensko,</hi> with an account of what they had done. They were received with much Honour, many prime Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and all the Horſe being ſent to meet them. Being introduced into the King's preſence, they humbly beſought him in the name of all the Orders of <hi>Muskovy,</hi> that he would be pleaſed to take them and their afflicted Country into his Royal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. They then ſollicite the ſpeedy diſpatch of the Prince to them, that in order to the compleating of their unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Election, he might publikely be Crowned in the Royal City Great Duke and Emperour; and that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comfort of his Preſence and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. They likewiſe brought with them
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93173:99"/>the Conditions upon which he was to be received; wherein the moſt conſiderable were: That a General Amneſty and Act of Oblivion ſhould be paſſed, and all their Laws and Cuſtoms confirmed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; and that for the better ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Kingdom, their Duke muſt abjure the Romiſh Profeſſion, and declare himſelf for the Greek Rites. The King having received their Meſſage, and not ignorant of the wilineſs and reſerves of that ſubtle Nation, was not wanting in a return ſutable to the occaſion. He told them, that he did receive this Honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon his Son with great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which ſhould oblige him at all times to ſerve their Country with his beſt Aids and Counſels. And as to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, relating to its particulars, he did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give <hi>Zolkievius</hi> (then upon the place) full Inſtructions for the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it at their own homes. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors after this Anſwer, and having been ſumptuouſly feaſted by the Prime Officers of the Court, with great and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual profeſſions of kindneſſes, in ſo much as they ſeemed to be but one people, were diſmiſſed.</p>
            <p>The King having by this fully weighed
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93173:99"/>the ſtate of his Affairs, gathered to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf many reaſons not to believe the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Moſcovites;</hi> for elſe why did they elect his Son and not him, but that they ſhould be able when he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn his Forces out of their Land, to practiſe upon the unexperience of his Son by reaſon of his youth, and to juſtle him out of the Throne, to which they had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him out of neceſſity, not choice? And on the other ſide, if the King ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſend him to them till he were of Age, they would take occaſion from this delay to transfer their Suffrage upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He took a further Umbrage of their Deſignes from the refuſal of the Garriſon of <hi>Smolensko</hi> to ſurrender their City in the name of Prince <hi>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93173:100"/>gained the Kings ear, they inſtill'd new Counſels into him: That this Election of his Son was an affront, and an impoſing upon his Majeſty, inſtead of receiving Law from him: That he had by his Arms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to thoſe diſtreſſes, that they muſt ſuddenly lay themſelves, that they muſt ſuddenly lay themſelves at his feet; whereas now they addreſſed to him by their Embaſſadors with Conditions not only inglorious, but inconſiſtent with the ſtate of his Affairs, and impoſſible for him to ſubſcribe to: And that upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> he might conſider himſelf as a Conqueror, and Rule that falſe People by ſuch Laws as he ſhould judge ſutable to his Honour and Safety. But there were others of his Council that adviſed the preſerving of that Faith which <hi>Zolkievius</hi> had Sworn to them in his Name, and by his Approbation: That by confirming of that, he would in one day render himſelf Maſter of a vaſt Empire, which it might coſt him ſome years, beſides a great expence of Blood and Treaſure to reduce. And they being an obſtinate people, might fall upon new Counſels, and cloſe with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> whoſe Title would give him a trouble to reſiſt, as well upon the account of Reaſon, as the power
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93173:100"/>of his Arms. For it was upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of aiding <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that he inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their land; who being reſtored to the Throne, the King could have no more a fair colour to ſtay in it: That his Army might by this means be paid all their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears, as the Souldiers of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaws</hi> the Great Duke, out of the Treaſures of <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia;</hi> whereas the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> if it fell to them to pay it, would grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie under ſo intolerable a burthen: That the practiſes of the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> might eaſily be eluded by ſeating <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaws</hi> upon the Throne with an able Council about him, who ſhould immediately provide pay for the Army, which they would not refuſe upon his firſt reception, and while it lay in their Chief City: And as to the Articles, they might be well enough evaded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, while more Recruits were coming out of <hi>Poland.</hi> But the King's mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepoſſeſſed, as if carried on by an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Fate, adhered to the more violent Counſels of ſuch as blew him up with a Punctilio of Honour, not to riſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Smolensko</hi> before he had reduced it, having coſt him already above a years Siege, and was now upon the point of a rendition, or being forced. The King had
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93173:101"/>raiſed a Battery againſt it, but did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his matters with that quickneſs, but that they within had time to make a deep Ditch, and to raiſe new Ramparts in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Battery: after which the Cannon began to play; which indeed laid flat a great part of the Wall, with two Flankers that ſtood next it: the Aſſault was made, but in vain, they being repulſed with great loſs. The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> in the mean time clamoured at this breach of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which had been celebrated with the Solemnity of an Oath; and that contrary to the Law of Nations, their Embaſſadors were detained. Which the King juſtified upon this Reaſon, that they refuſed to give order to the Governour of <hi>Smolens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko</hi> to ſurrender the Town in their Great Dukes Name; and which they excuſed, as not within their Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>The Affairs of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> hung thus in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for ſome time, the people not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to do more than mutter, while <hi>Zol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kievius</hi> and his Army lay enquartered in their Chief City. <hi>Demetrius</hi> alſo began to look up again, having ſheltered himſelf in <hi>Caluga,</hi> while he was reinforcing his Party, which was much countenanced by the return of <hi>Zarucki</hi> and Prince <hi>Kazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mowski</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:93173:101"/>to him, whoſe reception by King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> bearing no proportion with what they propoſed to themſelves, left him, and returned again to the Service of their old Lord. But <hi>Zolkievius</hi> diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be thus treated by the King, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted violent diſcontents, in ſo much that taking the pretence of going to fetch the Prince to <hi>Musko,</hi> he left the Army; and paſſing by <hi>Smolensko,</hi> where he but ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King, he retired into <hi>Poland.</hi> The <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> after the Generals departure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that the King had refuſed ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son at his interceſſion, that the captive <hi>Zuiskius</hi>'s, together with their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors were ſent away Priſoners into <hi>Poland,</hi> and that the King took upon him the Adminiſtration of the Affairs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, putting new Officers into all the great places, and refuſing to own them as a State, prepared for a Revolt; to which the death of <hi>Demetrius</hi> did very effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contribute. He had a little before, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome apprehenſions of infidelity in <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimouski</hi> againſt him, cauſed him to be thrown into the River <hi>Occa,</hi> and drowned there; which the <hi>Tartars</hi> of his Guard ſo far reſented, as to ſtudy a revenge. He was of late time uſed to divert his Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:93173:102"/>with drinking, drowning, at leaſt ſteeping his cares in liquor: and having been one day a hunting, he retired himſelf with ſome of his particular Friends to the enjoyment of this accuſtomed ſolace, when theſe enraged <hi>Tartars</hi> broke in upon him, and murthered him upon the place. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they eſcape Vengeance: for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina</hi> receiving this news with the moſt violent apprehenſion in the world, and laying aſide all reſpect to her Quality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſported with grief and rage, ſhe ran into the Streets, calling to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe met, either to revenge the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of her Lord, or by the ſame cruelty to do an act of Charity towards her, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering her from that loathed burthen of her life. The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> inflamed by the Prayers and Tears of this great Lady, fell with ſuch fury upon the <hi>Tartars,</hi> that they ſacrificed two hundred of them to <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> his <hi>Manes, Marina's</hi> grief, and their own reſentments. This ſecond <hi>Demetrius</hi> after his death, was by all hands admitted to be an Impoſtor. Moſt would have him to have been a School-Maſter in <hi>Socola</hi> a Town of <hi>Ruſſia Alba,</hi> and that he had been ſet up as a Property by the <hi>Poles,</hi> the better to countenance their Deſignes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93173:102"/>
               <hi>Muskovy.</hi> Others ſuppoſed him a Jew, upon this Reaſon, that there were found in his Cloſet ſome Hebrew and Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudical Books; the ſame being likewiſe affirmed by <hi>Michael Federowiez</hi> the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Emperour, in a Letter from him to <hi>Maurice</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> But whoever he was, he was ſlain by theſe <hi>Tartars</hi> as we have related, but did not die ſo entirely, but that his Son was choſe Great Duke by them of <hi>Caluga;</hi> and <hi>Zaruckius</hi> with all his Forces addreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> offering them their aid, upon promiſe that ſo ſoon as they ſhould quit their hands of the <hi>Poles,</hi> they ſhould by the example of <hi>Caluga,</hi> chuſe this Son of <hi>Demetrius</hi> Great Duke and Emperour. This being aſſented to, this Son of <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Marina</hi> was in thoſe Quarters conſidered as Emperor; though many believed this yet a further Impoſtor, for that <hi>Marina</hi> was ſuppoſed barren.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> continued ſtill the Siege of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> which he judged ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious and below him to abandon; though while he opiniatred there, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted more ſpecious opportunities of prevailing elſewhere, and by this delaying gave the <hi>Muskovites</hi> means to regain what
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93173:103"/>by their Diviſions had been extorted from them. It was now the beginning of the Year 1611, when they began to take Arms under the Conduct of <hi>Lepanow</hi> a Great Lord of the Country, who having made ſome private Levies, appeared in the field firſt about <hi>Prezlaw,</hi> from whence he invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and gained moſt of the <hi>Boyarians</hi> to his Party, diſperſing Meſſengers into all the Provinces, to reproach the <hi>Poles</hi> of their breach of Faith in detaining their Prince from them; complaining further, that they had got their City of <hi>Musko</hi> by fraud and practice; and that they kept the <hi>Zuiski</hi>'s in Priſon together with their Embaſſadors, contrary to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Zarucki</hi> brought in his Force to this Party, upon the Conditions before mentioned, that young <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſhould be received and declared Emperour and Great Duke, ſo ſoon as they ſhould have cleared their Country from the <hi>Poles,</hi> the plague of it. And <hi>Proſowecki</hi> another Great Lord raiſed another and greater Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my about <hi>Novogrodock;</hi> ſo that theſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, from ſmall beginnings, did by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertencie of the <hi>Poles</hi> improve to that bulk, that none of the Kings Forces ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Country for the ſecuring its
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93173:103"/>Obedience, durſt look upon them, they ſcarce ſufficing to defend themſelves. He could not ſpare any of his Leaguer from before <hi>Smolensko,</hi> having a great Line to man, and the Enemy a ſtrong Garriſon in the Town: his Army in <hi>Musko</hi> was little enough to keep the numbers in the City in ſubjection; whoſe old averſion to the <hi>Poles</hi> was revived to ſo high a pitch, that upon notice of <hi>Lepanow</hi>'s being in Arms, they conſpired how to Maſſacre the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, conſiſting of 6000 Horſe, and 1000 Foot. They wanted only Leaders, not a will to this bloody action. There were within the circuit of this vaſt City one hundred and eighty thouſand houſes, a multitude of Inhabitants, beſides a great confluence of Strangers retired thither out of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Provinces for Sanctuary, to avoid the fury of a Civil War; and many to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Conſpirators, as conſcious of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Deſigne; ſo that they only want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Head and Method for the carrying of it on. <hi>Goziouski</hi> General of the <hi>Poles</hi> was not without his Intelligence of theſe <hi>Menés,</hi> but choſe rather to diſſemble his notice, being only intent upon his forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of <hi>Kitaigrod</hi> and <hi>Krimgrod,</hi> which contain within their Walls the Dukes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93173:104"/>with the Ware-houſes of the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt Merchants; propoſing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he ſhould be able to retire thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon occaſion. <hi>Gariouski</hi> had ſcarce finiſhed his Works, when the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying by their malice what they wanted in conduct, being carried on as it were by the weight of their number, drawn together by the ringing of their Bells, the third day after Palm-Sunday made a furious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault upon the Enemy in their boſome. The <hi>Poles</hi> oppoſed Deſpair and Diſcipline to their confuſed multitudes, and were ſo ſucceſsful in it, as to kill 6000 upon the place without any conſiderable loſs; and proſecuting that advantage by firing that part of the City next them, they deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed multitudes of Houſes, Women, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Goods, and helpleſs People, by the aid of that raging Element. The day following, <hi>Gariouski</hi> commanded the Suburbs on the other ſide of the River <hi>Moſcha</hi> to be burnt, becauſe that <hi>Struſius,</hi> who was haſtening to the relief of his Countreymen with his Regiment from <hi>Moſaiſco,</hi> was retarded there by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. The City tamed thus by Fire and Sword, rejecting the fault upon ſome few, petitioned for pardon, and had it without
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:93173:104"/>great difficulty, the <hi>Poles</hi> not being in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to do more than ſecure their own Quarters, though they had gained well to bring the Enemy to aſk quarter of them. It was neither compunction in the one, nor kindneſs in the other, that begat this calm; for the Inhabitants upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of <hi>Lepanow</hi> with <hi>Zarucki</hi> and <hi>Proſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wecki</hi> with an Army of 100000 men, joyned with them, forcing the <hi>Poles</hi> into their Works, where they were beſieged, ſave on one paſſage over the River, which they kept open a long time, and by which they got in their Proviſions, and made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sallies with various Fortune and Succeſs.</p>
            <p>All this while King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> lay im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable at the Siege of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> which dured longer than he had fancied; but what was worſe, the Souldiers grew uneaſie for want of Pay, clamouring in ſuch ſort, that he was in much dread of a Mutiny. He had no Moneys, neither did he know how to compaſs any without a Convention of the States of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and this he was put upon to calm the Souldiers, who were prevailed with to expect the determinations of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly with patience. But the King, that
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93173:105"/>no Objection might lie upon him for not having made all imaginable Attempts for gaining the place, reſolved upon a general Aſſault before he left the Leaguer to go to the Convention, which he had appointed in <hi>September</hi> following. The Aſſault was contrived to be made before day-break, and was carried on accordingly with leſs notice, or indeed expectation of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my than was imagined; for the Souldiers had without great oppoſition raiſed three Ladders upon the Wall before it was light, upon the 13th of <hi>June. Potocki</hi> the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of <hi>Brachlaw</hi> had his Poſt on the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Town; <hi>Wyer</hi> with his <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> on the Kings ſide; who both of them got up to the top of the Walls: but the deſcent being ſteep into the Town, and the Garriſon flocking to the place, rendred the diſpute hot and doubtful, till <hi>Bartholomew Novodwoski</hi> Captain of the Guards apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Petar under the Kennel on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide towards the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> made a Breach of 30 Cubits long. <hi>Doroſtanski</hi> Marſhal of <hi>Lithuania</hi> aſſaulted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the ſame in the head of the Guards, and marched directly to the Market-place, poſſeſſing himſelf of it with little reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: for the Garriſon aſtoniſhed with this unexpected Adventure, ſwallowed up
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93173:105"/>in their own fears, inſtead of making any defence, threw down their Arms and quitted their Stations, leaving a free paſſage for the Beſiegers to enter in on all ſides upon them. All was fill'd with horror and confuſion; the <hi>Poles</hi> enraged they had been ſo long a Conquering, put all they met with to the Sword. The poor Citizens not knowing where to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the fury of this bloody Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, were butchered without remorſe or diſtinction; which poſſeſſing others with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair and indignation, very many of them took their Wives, Children, &amp; moſt pretious Moveables, and retired with them into the great Church, where was kept the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of Powder; and putting fire to it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed themſelves with a more than <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntine</hi> deſpair, for fear of periſhing. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hin</hi> Palatine and Governour of the Town with 15 more, got into a little Tower upon the Wall, where, though all was loſt, he bravely defended himſelf, telling the Enemy, that he reſolved to die rather than render himſelf, unleſs to ſome Chief Officer. He had been exemplary for his cruelty to ſuch as were taken upon any Sallies, which gave the <hi>Poles</hi> a particular hatred for him; and he dreaded worſe than death falling
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:93173:106"/>into their hands: but word being brought to <hi>Potocki,</hi> who was near that Quarter, he came to the place, to whom the Palatine and his fifteen Camerades yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon Parole, Priſoners of War. And thus was this great City, which had been the labour of almoſt two years, taken in leſs than two hours time, with the loſs only of eight <hi>Germans.</hi> The gaining of the place was juſtly attributed to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Novodwoski</hi>'s Petar; that attempt of ſcaling the Walls being wholly deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and in which the Aſſailants muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably have periſhed. So ſoon as the poſſeſſion of that place was ſecured, there was a ſtrict Command to give Quarter; only the Pillage of the Town was conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Souldiers, as the reward of their labours; but they not agreeing in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of it, the Booty was ordered to be brought into one place, whereby the dividend might be more equal; but a fire by ſome accident happening, conſumed all that Wealth, with a great part of the City. There was found in the Magazines a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Corn and other Military Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions ſufficient for three years longer: Men were only wanting, they being waſted from near 70000 to about 8000 fighting
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93173:106"/>men; but however, had they not been more conquered by their own fears than the power of the Enemy, they had certainly made good the place againſt this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</p>
            <p>The King having appeaſed his Army, feaſted them three whole days together; in the ſolace of which, and the reflection of their Victory, they buried all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer regrets and diſcontents. And he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he ſhould now appear more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly to his own Subjects, had a greater appetite of being at the Aſſembly than before, propoſing to himſelf, that Crowned with the Palms of this Conqueſt, he ought to ſhew himſelf in Triumph to his people: adding this Error to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (as if ſwayed by ſome ſecret Fatality) he turned his back upon his new Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, to receive the flatteries and accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of his <hi>Poliſh</hi> Subjects. And thus he yet again ſuffered the vanquiſhed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Muskovy</hi> to ſlip out of his hands: for if he had proſecuted his Victory, and had carried the Terror of his Arms, and the reputation of his Succeſs to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial City, where his men diſputed his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt with great courage, againſt the multitude that oppreſſed them, and where
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93173:107"/>he had a conſiderable Party amongſt the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> themſelves, it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he had not only kept the City in his power, but by the Example of it have compelled the reſt of the Provinces to receive his Dictates at pleaſure. But he, by an ill computation of his Affairs, and that unhappy cunctation which loſt him his Hereditary Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> loſt now alſo the Monarchy of <hi>Muskovy:</hi> For as ſoon as the Beſieged and Beſiegers at <hi>Musko</hi> had notice that he was gone, it had different effects upon them. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from without grew confident, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating their Attempts upon the <hi>Poles;</hi> who looking upon themſelves as expoſed, began to contrive for their own ſafety; and taking a pretence from their want of pay (but the true reaſon was a deſpair of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief) they demanded their diſmiſſion.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly of the Eſtates at <hi>Warſow</hi> was held with the uſual Ceremony, but unuſual Pomp, the King being received as a Conqueror, with all imaginary Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations for the reducing of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> and adding ſo fair a Province to their Commonwealth. <hi>Zolkievius</hi> his Triumph was Memorable and Magnificent: for being attended by a gallant and numerous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallery,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:93173:107"/>he was followed by <hi>Baſilius Zuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki</hi> late Emperour of <hi>Muskovy,</hi> who was clad in a red ſilk Veſt, and ſeated in a high Chariot betwixt his two Brothers, that he might be ſeen of all men. They rode thus to the Senate-houſe, where being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Zolkievius</hi> preſented the Captive Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the King and Aſſembly; and in a grave and ſet Speech, having magnified the Majeſty of the Commonwealth, and the adverſe Fortune of the Priſoners, made no ſcruple to parallel the Conqueſt of theſe Illuſtrious Captives to the moſt renowned Examples of former Ages. After this, the <hi>Zuiski</hi>'s were confined to <hi>Goſton</hi>-Caſtle, where they were Royally treated, though <hi>Baſilius</hi> impatient of his Fetters, and not able to ſupport the weight of his ſorrows, died ſoon after, and was privately buried betwixt <hi>Warſow</hi> and <hi>Thorn,</hi> where he alſo repoſed till the end of the War; at which time, his and his Brother <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Aſhes, who likewiſe died there, were at the interceſſion of the <hi>Muskovitiſh</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors tranſlated out of <hi>Poland</hi> to the Tomb of their Anceſtors. In the mean time, King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> to perpetuate the Memory of ſo great a Victory, cauſed it to be ingraved in Tables of Marble, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93173:108"/>placed upon his Monument, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:

            <p>And this was the end of <hi>Baſilius Zuiski,</hi> who having by many extraordinary Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raiſed himſelf to the Throne, enjoyed it no more than his Predeceſſor, either long or quietly. He had to do with an unſtable People, hurried from one extreme to another; and being of a jealous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had recourſe to Witchcrafts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations, endeavouring by the help of Sathan to preſerve what he had gained by improving the violent humour of the gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy multitude. And his Wizards furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with Diſcoveries of the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſome about him, or he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Diſcoveries, to gratifie his fears, put many eminent Perſons to death; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing to ſettle that Dominion by Blood and Fraud, the ſame Arts whereby he had obtained it. And his nature by frequent practiſes being hardened in cruelty, he cauſed three of his moſt faithful Servants and Friends to be made away, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their names were <hi>Michael;</hi> for he had been told by his Soothſayers, that one of that name ſhould Succeed him in the Empire (which proved true, for all his barbarous precaution) which hurried him upon doing thoſe horrid things that hardly any Story can parallel. He would tear up
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93173:109"/>the Wombs of great-bellied women, and rip open the breaſts of the mettledſt Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for the immature fruit of the one, and the hearts of the other, wherewith he uſed to make his Diabolical Infuſions; as well to charm the <hi>Poles</hi> whom he could not overcome, as his Rebel-Subjects whom he could not bring to their Duty. But no Magick is of power againſt the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, which after a ſhort turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Reign, removed him from the Throne to a Priſon, where he ended his days.</p>
            <p>The Method of our Tragick Hiſtory doth invite us back to <hi>Musko,</hi> to obſerve the actions of that place; but <hi>Zolkievius,</hi> whoſe Army we left there, having in the ſucceeding courſe of his life rendered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf famous upon the account of many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, eſpecially his unparallel'd Retreat at <hi>Cicora</hi> from the <hi>Turks,</hi> a ſhort digreſſion as to his Affairs may not be wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, wherein I ſhall obſerve my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed brevity, to relate only matter of fact, and ſo return to where we left.</p>

               <hi>Staniſlaws Zolkiewski</hi> (the Sirnames of moſt of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility do end in <hi>ski</hi>) a Perſon of an eminent extraction, dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to Arms ſo ſoon as he was well able to wield them, making his firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſhip
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93173:109"/>under that Great Chancellour, and greateſt Captain that <hi>Poland</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for many Ages, <hi>John Zamoyski;</hi> who at the famous Battle of <hi>Byczin,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided the conteſt between <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> and <hi>Maximilian</hi> concerning the Crown, in favour of the former, had the Honour to Command the Right Wing of <hi>Zamoyski</hi>'s Army, to the defeating of that Enemy that oppoſed him; in which encounter he received a ſore wound in the Knee. His Conduct in that Adventure raiſed him in ſhort time after to the Preferment of being Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which Command, he was employed againſt the Rebellious <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many doubtful Fights he reduced to his own Terms, of delivering up their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral (a Plebeian, but of great Conduct) with three other of their Principal Officers into his hands. He defeated the <hi>Swedes</hi> at <hi>Revel:</hi> And afterwards being made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, he did beat the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> at <hi>Cluſinum,</hi> entred <hi>Musko,</hi> forced <hi>Demetrius</hi> to quit his Siege, and led away the Emperour <hi>Zuiski</hi> and his two Brothers Captive with him into <hi>Poland,</hi> as we have formerly mentioned; and likewiſe that he left the Army in <hi>Musko</hi> upon diſcontent, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> refuſed to ratifie the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which <hi>Zolkievius</hi> by his directions had in his name ſworn to.</p>
            <p>Being 70 years of Age, he was created Great Chancellor of <hi>Poland:</hi> He repreſſed the <hi>Tartars</hi> in their Invaſion at <hi>Orimin;</hi> and a while after marched with his Army into <hi>Moldavia</hi> in aid of <hi>Gratian</hi> the <hi>Vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vod</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> that oppreſſed him to ſo great an extremity, that he came in to <hi>Zolkievius</hi> but with ſix hundred Horſe; but ſo fatally negligent, that he could give no account of the Enemies number or force, even in his own County; ſo that the General had nothing certain of them, till he ſaw them cover the <hi>Campania</hi> about him with their numerous hoaſt. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had encamped upon the Plains of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cora,</hi> determining in that place to attend their motion. This was in <hi>Sept.</hi> 1620. The <hi>Tartars,</hi> who had joyned with the <hi>Turks</hi> upon this occaſion, having taken ſome Chriſtian Priſoners, gained from them an account of the Chriſtian ſtrength, which did not exceed 10000 effective men: whereupon they drew up within view of them, with an Army of double their number, led by their Commander <hi>Cantimir Murſa.</hi> A few hours after, they
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93173:110"/>were followed by <hi>Skinder Baſſa</hi> General of the <hi>Turks</hi> and of the War, who pitcht his Tents near thoſe of his Confederates within view of the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Poles</hi> contained themſelves within their Trenches, till a Squadron of <hi>Coſſacks</hi> who had the out-Guard, encountred that of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> whom after a ſmart diſpute, they forced to a Retreat; but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by their own men, they turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chriſtians, purſuing them up to their very Trenches, where they alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſonably reinforced, oppoſed the prevailing Enemy with ſo great Succeſs, that having killed a great number, they chaſed them into their Main Body; but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Quarter, did conſequently take no Priſoners, and ſo made no diſcovery of the Enemies ſtrength; in ſo much that <hi>Zolkievius</hi> making his computation by what appeared in view, and finding his Army chearful upon the Succeſs of that days Action, reſolved to put all upon the fottune of a Battle. That night there came to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp <hi>Sultan Galga</hi> the Great <hi>Chams</hi> Brother, with a freſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of 30000 choice Souldiers, whereof <hi>Zolkievius</hi> had no knowledge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in order to the determinations of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93173:111"/>day before, he drew out his whole Army early the next morning, being the 19th of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1620. and ranging them in Battalia, ſtrengthened both Wings with Forts made of his Waggons and Carriages, cloſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on all ſides, and filled with Foot and Cannon, ſo that the Enemy could make no advantage of their numbers to infeſt their Flanks. <hi>Skinder Baſſa</hi> on the other ſide ſeeing the Order of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, drew his Army into a Line of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, placing only the <hi>Turks,</hi> revolted <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachians</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvanians</hi> in view, the Auxiliary <hi>Tartars</hi> being placed out of ſight, and commanded not to ſtir till a Signal was given them to move, which ſhould be when the Chriſtians were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. The <hi>Poles</hi> had indeed ordered their Reſerves, but by an over-confidence advanced upon the Enemy from without the protection of their Forts, contrary to the Generals Orders; which the Enemy obſerving, the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſhewed themſelves on the Right Wing; and extending that way, endeavoured to get between the Chriſtians Camp and the Rear of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; which obliged <hi>Zolkievius</hi> to oppoſe againſt them his Reſerves. The Fight was Bloody and doubtful for two hours
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93173:111"/>together; but the Main Battle of the <hi>Poles</hi> having no Seconds (by reaſon of the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Reſerves to defend the Rear) oppreſſed by the often-repeated Charges of the Enemies freſh Troops, however keeping within the protection of their Forts on the left Wing, were no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuſtain the Impreſſion of thoſe mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes that ſwarmed upon them: they therefore faced about, and breaking through thoſe Squadrons of <hi>Tartars</hi> who had got between them and the Camp, made their retreat in reaſonable good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: the Barbarians being checked in their Purſuit by the Forts before-mentioned, which were ſtill defended by the <hi>Poles.</hi> That on the Right Wing was violently aſſaulted by the Enemy, who killed three hundred of the Defendants, and took four of their Field-Pieces; neither had their Succeſs reſted there, but that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans not wanting to themſelves in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, advanced with their beſt Troops to their relief, forcing the Infidels, after a hot diſpute, to a confuſed Retreat. The Fort or Caſtle on the other Wing was left unattempted; and night drawing on, the Enemy, after a kind of drawn Battle, wherein there fell 1000 of theirs, and about
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93173:112"/>ſix hundred of the Chriſtians, retreated to their Tents. The reſt of that night and the following day were paſt without any Attempt on either ſide. The <hi>Poles</hi> in the mean time went to counſel, what was to be done upon this preſſing occaſion; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an extraordinary nature, they were able to fall upon no probable Reſolutions. During this time of their Conſultation, there was a report ſpread about the Camp, of a purpoſe in the Chief Officers to ſteal away from the Army; which put the Souldiers into confuſion, till they were undeceived by the generous profeſſions of their Leaders, who vowed to live and die with them. <hi>Zolkievius</hi> propoſed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that they ſhould the next day try the fortune of another Battle, wherein they might eaſily correct the errors of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer day; and being now informed of their own and the Enemies ſtrength, they could better lay hold of ſuch advantages as ſhould occur, having failed more in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct than Courage; and if the Succeſs of the next day ſhould not anſwer the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, they might then think of retiring towards the confines of their Countrey, where they ſhould be ſure to meet with new Supplies for the further proſecution
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93173:112"/>of the War. The very mention of another Battle ſurprized many of the Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, eſpecially <hi>Alexander Kalinowski,</hi> Duke <hi>Corecki,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Struſe,</hi> three of the moſt eminent Lords in the Army, who maligning the Command of <hi>Zolkie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> were the more apt to oppoſe his Counſels, eſpecially in this juncture, which muſt bring their lives to an apparent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard. They therefore abſolutely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt it, and that there was no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but in a ſudden flight; by which means they might avoid death, or a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, which was yet more terrible: and being reſolved to put the Counſels they had given in execution that night, they took the firſt opportunity after the Watch was ſet, to quit the Camp, propoſing to themſelves, that by the favour of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they might get over the River <hi>Prut,</hi> which covered the Rear of the Camp, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Enemy could take the Alarm of their departure. <hi>Gratian</hi> the <hi>Vayvod,</hi> for whoſe preſervation the War was underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, went away with them; and having by the number of their Train and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants made a conſiderable Party, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded themſelves of ſtrength able, by the advantage of the night, to break through
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:93173:113"/>all oppoſition. There was a ſecond Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſpread about in the Army, that the General himſelf was likewiſe gone; which bearing terrour with it, the inferior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Souldiers were upon preparation for their flight alſo; whereof he having ſpeedy notice, mounted on Horſback, and cauſing many lighted Torches to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him, ſhewed himſelf to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; ſurrounded the Quarters, ſpoke to every one he met, and animated all with his preſence and chearfulneſs. He added, <hi>That he could not be guilty of ſo nefarious a Treaſon, as to deſert ſo many brave men, his fellow-Souldiers; they had ſerved too long under his Command, to conceive their General capable of ſo wretched an act, as to ſully all his Honour by ſo ſordid a Retreat. That for his part he had no other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his life, but in order to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: and ſince ſome (he must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, eminent Perſons) had preferred that to all ſence of Honour, he was glad they were gone, hoping they had carried away with them that infection of Cowardize, which might have tainted the whole Army. He alſo would wiſh them a good Journey, provided they would tell the King and ſuch of their Friends that ſhould enquire after
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93173:113"/>them, that they had abandoned the Army and their General in the Plains of</hi> Cicora, <hi>engaged against theirs and the Common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of Chriſtianity. Zolkievius,</hi> though he had harangued his Souldiers in theſe kind of Terms, and with a ſerene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, yet had he much ado to compoſe thoſe minds which were agitated with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and fear; who could not be perſwaded to return to their Duty, until a ſence of the danger of their diſobedience obliged them to it. But they were wholly confirmed by the ill Succeſs of thoſe who had deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, who by their degenerous flight had haſtened, not prevented their ruine. For in paſſing the River, which was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rapid than deep, many of them miſſing the Ford, were overwhelmed in it. <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linowski</hi> himſelf periſhed in the ſtream; and ſuch as got over, at leaſt moſt of them, were knocked in the head by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who had the Guard of that Poſt. <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and his <hi>Moldavians</hi> being skill'd in the Paſſage and ways, got clear off; but being purſued by his ill Fate, had the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his infamous flight rewarded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by the perfidy of his own Servants, who murthered their Lord, to poſſeſs themſelves of what Treaſure he had
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93173:114"/>brought away with him. The reſt of the Party, after a vain Attempt to paſs the River, not daring to land on the other ſide, wet, weary, and confounded with ſhame, came back for refuge to the Camp, which a while before they had forſaken as deſperate, repoſing now all their ſafety in that of the Army. The <hi>Poles</hi> by theſe loſſes, and the eſcape of 900 <hi>Coſſacks</hi> (who by a more lucky fate than that of their Fellows, had broke through a neglected Quarter of the Enemy without oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) being much weakned, and far une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in ſtrength to the Enemy, and not daring to attempt another fight without manifeſt hazard to looſe all, reſolved upon a retreat.</p>
            <p>They had loſt many of their Horſes, and more died daily for want of Forrage: they were harraſſed with duty, and had no hopes of relief from <hi>Poland,</hi> being beſieged by a barbarous Enemy, ready every moment (at leaſt in their apprehenſion) to ſtorm their Camp: their Proviſions were ſhort, and no poſſibility of Supplies from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, all the ſides of their Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inveſted, ſo that it was impoſſible for them to ſubſiſt for want of Food, in expectation of ſuccour from their
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93173:114"/>own Country. Neither had the King, by reaſon of the interruption of the Paſſages, received but one Letter from <hi>Zolkievius,</hi> when it was too late, wherein he gave him an account of his condition, and how he had been unſeaſonably abandoned by ſome of the Army. This was the ſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in the Camp, while the Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lay cloſe upon them; and computing the diſtreſſes and diſorders within, by the deſertion of thoſe that had left them, they were much raiſed in their hopes, deſpiſing all propoſals and overtures of quitting the place: In ſo much that upon the 22th of <hi>September</hi> the whole <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army was drawn up before the Camp, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a general Aſſault, unleſs they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſurrendred at diſcretion. On the 23th they did the like; and on the 26th the <hi>Galga</hi> or Prince of <hi>Tartary</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nearer the Trenches, was met by Duke <hi>Corecki</hi> upon Parole, who propoſed to him an exceſſive ranſom for himſelf and ſome few with him; and deſcending to ſome particulars for a rendition of the Camp, only that the Souldiers might march away with their Swords, the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> left him in ſcorn and anger, and clapping his hand upon his Sable, bid him
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93173:115"/>expect no other conditions than what the ſharpneſs of that would afford him. <hi>Zol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kievius</hi> having throughly computed the ſtate of his Affairs, reſolved to quit the Camp; and having ordered all things accordingly, which took up three days time, being aſſiſted in the method of his Deſigne by <hi>Martin Kaſanowski</hi> an old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Colonel: and upon the 29th of <hi>September</hi> that part of the Wall through which the Camp was to paſs being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Army about Sun-ſet began its march in the order following: On both ſides a row of Waggons, as it were chained toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, five hundred paces in length, drawn by their Horſes, cloſed the Wings. The Front conſiſting likewiſe of linked Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, took up three hundred paces; and the Rear being fenced with the like Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricado, was (as alſo the other extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Camp) fortified with Cannon. The wounded, ſick, Baggage, and all the beſt Horſes of the Army, were placed in the middeſt, while the Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers marched on the out-ſide of the Camp with Colours flying, and their Arms rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy fixed to reſiſt any impreſſion. The <hi>Tartars</hi> obſerving this order of the <hi>Poles,</hi> did at firſt think they had drawn out to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93173:115"/>fight; but when they diſcerned the whole Camp to move, and that no man ſtirred out of his Rank, they ſtood amazed at the Novelty; and the night being ſo near, they durſt do no more but ſend out ſmall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to obſerve their motion. And ſo they marched two <hi>Moldaviſh</hi> Miles that night without any diſorder, ſave what they received at the paſſage of a Lake; which was ſupplied well enough, in reſpect they were not eagerly preſſed upon by the Enemy. On the 30th of <hi>September, Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Baſſa</hi> aſſaulted the Camp on all ſides with his united Forces; but being repelled with great loſs, they marched yet two <hi>Moldaviſh</hi> Miles more that night. A <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh</hi> Mile is more than a <hi>German.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the firſt of <hi>October,</hi> the Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lodged near a great Pool, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there that whole day and the night following. The Infidels did extremely gall them from the other ſide of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their ſhot, and from the open ſide by their Excurſions; but were bravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed with great ſlaughter of their men. About Noon that day they prepared for a freſh Aſſault; but inſtead thereof, ſent a Trumpet to the Camp to demand their <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Interpreter, that they might ſpeak
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93173:116"/>with him; which being granted, they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detained him, making no Attempt that day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 2. The <hi>Turks</hi> having the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved the Camp, ſtormed it with greater fury than ever; and being repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, returned fifteen times to the Aſſault. The Courage of the Defendants grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by their being able to reſiſt; in ſo much that at laſt it did not only ſuffice them to make good their Station, but that they followed the flying Enemy to a good diſtance from it; in which Purſuit they took two Colours and a Piece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, having killed multitudes of their men. Towards Sun-ſet they began their March, with their ſhot about them; which muſt needs retard their pace; and yet they advanced three of their Miles before Morning, being by computation fifteen Engliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 3. Having gained the Advantage of a Rivulet and heights of Ground, they eaſily repreſſed the Enemies fury, and took a <hi>Tartar</hi> Colours; they alſo eluded an Ambuſh of the Enemy, and continued their Journey that night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 4. They had ſtrengthened their Camp by the Neighbourhood of a River.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93173:116"/>But <hi>Skinder Baſſa</hi> conſidering that by theſe Marches by night, the Prey might ſlip out of his hands; and ſenſible of the diſgrace that would attend him to ſuffer it, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make an Attempt at the hazard of his whole Army; and conſequently gave order for a general Aſſault. But being the <hi>Tartars</hi> were not ſo forward as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, having been ſo many times baffled, pretending the difficulty by reaſon of the poſture of the Camp, ſeated upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the River, by the help of which they would be able to bring more hands to the defence of thoſe parts that were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultable; but the enraged <hi>Baſſa</hi> impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of Arguments, turned haſtily to his <hi>Janizaries: And are you alſo affrighted with the greatneſs of the danger?</hi> ſaid he, <hi>And will you ſuffer this handful of men to ſlip out of your hands for want of a vigorous Attempt upon them?</hi> But they cried out, <hi>He ſhould not reproach but Command them, for nothing was terrible to them but the anger of their General.</hi> The reſt of the <hi>Turks</hi> ſway'd by this Example, would be of the Party, prompted by an Ambition to do the Service with their own hands, without the aid of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> And armed with theſe Reſolutions, they aſſaulted the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93173:117"/>Camp from all their Quarters; and preſſed on by a mixture of ſhame and fury, broke in upon it in one place, carrying their terror into the Bowels of their Enemy, maugre all the reſiſtance made againſt them. All their former diſputes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts ſeemed but ſport to this. The <hi>Turks</hi> hurried on by their Principle of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, added to a zeal of gratifying their General, made havock of their lives to preſerve the footing they had gained in the Camp, doing more than men in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the advantage. The Chriſtians armed with a native courage, inflamed yet by their deſpair, did more than they: for deſpiſing their multitudes, and reſolving to conquer or die, they made a charge upon thoſe who had entred, with a fury ſutable to the conſtitution of their Affairs; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them back, and upon thoſe that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made them contribute to their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, in ſuch ſort, that not being able to rally, they were repell'd with a great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And having clear'd themſelves from this violent ſtorm, they continued their march that evening alongſt the Banks of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for three Miles, the enemy coaſting them on the other ſide with an equal pace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 5. The <hi>Tartars</hi> having got before
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93173:117"/>them the day before, lay directly in their way; but they carrying with them the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of ſurmounting every difficulty, and grown ſkilful in this new kind of March, broke through all the reſiſtance made againſt them; though not without ſome diſorder in their Rear, occaſioned by the fears of the Waggon-men, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them leſs exact and faithful in their charge. But by the valour and conduct of <hi>Zemberg,</hi> who commanded in that part, the Enemy was repulſed; and the diſorder being repaired, they performed a March of two Miles that day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octob.</hi> 6. They ſtill advanced, and like a wedge of Iron divided their paſſage through the numerous Squadrons of the Enemy, who clouded their very ſight with their ſhowers of Shot and Arrows: but ſeeing they could make no impreſſion upon them, they burnt up and deſtroyed all their graſs and forrage in their way, whereby they were extremely incommodated, and by reaſon whereof, and their often Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, they were that day able to march but one <hi>Moldaviſh</hi> Mile.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Poles</hi> ſtill followed the Banks of the River <hi>Tire,</hi> with a deſigne to gain <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilow,</hi> a ſafe Retreat after their tedious
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93173:118"/>March. They were conſtrained to avoid the neareſt way thither, as mountainous &amp; bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, beſides great Woods in it, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> would obſtruct them in the manner of their motion; chuſing for the ſake of a more even paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to go about by ſuch a way as brought them within a Mile of their deſired Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The Camp was in perfect order; and the Enemy tired with a repetition of fruitleſs Attempts and labours, had forborn to preſs upon them, being content to wait on their motion by a few Scouts only. The <hi>Poles</hi> about the evening of this ſeventh day of their March, continued their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney according to their former Method; and meeting in their Paſſage with ſome Barns ſtored with great quantities of Hay and Corn, many of them, but without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ran to the Bait, to ſupply themſelves with Proviſions for their well-nigh-ſtarved Horſes. In the mean time, the Van of the Camp began to march, without calling in their Forragers, or giving notice, as they ought and uſed, to the Rear, of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Rear for want of the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Signe, being thus ſeparated from the Main Body, was ſeized on by a ſudden horror and pannick fear; which having laid hold on ſome, was like Wild-fire, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93173:118"/>through all. Their apprehenſions were various, but all upon the account of fear, heightned by the darkneſs and imaginary noiſes, concluding their Van was cut off, and that the Sword was at their Throats. The ſame plague being ſpread over the reſt of the Army, infected the whole in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with its contagion: whereupon the Carters, Waggon-men, Pedees, and Servants imploy'd about the Carriages, unlooſed the Horſes, to ſerve themſelves by flight upon them; ſo that the whole Fabrick and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine of the Camp being diſſolved, they could move no further. There was yet another cauſe (at leaſt contributary) to theſe Evils. Upon the departure of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> and other Fugitives from the Camp at <hi>Cicora,</hi> the Raſkality of the Army, with a mixture of Souldiers, robbed and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Tents and Lodgings; whereof the Officers in that juncture durſt not be over-inquiſitive: but being got on the Banks of the River <hi>Tire,</hi> they began to ſpeak of it; and <hi>Koninkspolski</hi> the Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had that very evening (improvidently enough) let fall ſome threatning expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning it. The number of the guilty being many, they began to think of their proper ſafety, and the avoiding that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93173:119"/>puniſhment, which if they ſtood to it would fall upon them; they therefore in great numbers fled away from their friends as well as their foes. Theſe wretches ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begun a Tumult upon this occaſion, the ſame was ſeconded by the dividing of the Camp, as is before declared. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion was ſo great, that <hi>Zolkievius</hi> and the chief Officers about him could not be heard; the variety of noiſes, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the danger, and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night, rendring the Army deaf to all his Commands and Orders. The <hi>Tartars</hi> being by their Scouts advertiſed of theſe Tumults, failed not to haſten thither; and working upon the advantage given them by the <hi>Poles,</hi> prepared to it by their own fears, fell in among them with ſhouts and terror. <hi>Zolkievius</hi> had Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that for the better ſafety of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and encouraging of the Souldiers, all men ſhould quit their Horſes, and march on foot; wherein himſelf was the firſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which was the reaſon that ſo many of the Chief Commanders fell, and were taken in that encounter: for when the Rout was become ſo univerſal, that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance was to no purpoſe, they periſhed upon the place, for want of Horſes to carry
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93173:119"/>them off, except ſuch as eſcaped by ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and ſo got away. <hi>Zolkievius</hi> his Son, with his Nephew and <hi>Struſius,</hi> the two former being weak of their Wounds, and forſaken by their Coachmen, were made Priſoners, and preſented to the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian Galga. Zolkievius</hi> had before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an eternal Farewel of his Son, and then having made a ſhort Confeſſion to his Ghoſtly Father, was loſt in the confuſion, but found dead next morning upon the ſkirts of the Camp: ſome ſay, he cauſed himſelf to be killed by one of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a <hi>Coſſack,</hi> chuſing rather to periſh with his Army, than fall into the Enemies hands, or ſurvive his own glory. But the Wounds in his Sword-hand, on his Face, and Breaſt, and a <hi>Tartarian</hi> laid dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by him, ſeem to declare that he was killed fighting. However it was, <hi>Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Baſſa</hi> cauſed his Head to be cut off and fixed upon a Pike, expoſing it for that day to the view of his whole Army; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be ſent to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> his Maſter, as a Teſtimony of his Victory. The Lieutenant-General, <hi>Corecki,</hi> the young <hi>Zolkievius,</hi> with the other Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Quality, were ſent to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> where after a three years impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93173:120"/>they were ranſomed, and returned to their own Country. And thus, like a Ship after a long voyage ſunk in the harbour, <hi>Zolkievius,</hi> having through all the accidents of his Life proceeded regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from the Quality of a private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to the Supreme Command of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, was raiſed by his own Virtue to thoſe Honours which rendered him eminent in thoſe parts of the World. Neither was there any thing wanting to compleat his Glory, beſides the Succeſs of this Retreat, which was reduced to that point, that there wanted but two hours ſpace to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him eminent amongſt the moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Captains of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>It is held of all hands, that the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult part of Military Service is in the right conduct of a Retreat; and it may be judged hard meaſure to deny <hi>Zolkie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> the Honour of having acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well in that particular, ſince he had brought it within view of the Harbour: but as the Honour of the Succeſs would have been entirely his had he proſpered, ſo his Memory muſt be patient of this Cloud drawn over the luſtre of it, by the failing of ſome mean Officer in omitting to give the Signal of his March. But here
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:93173:120"/>did he fall, and was laid upon the Bed of Honour in the extremity of his Age; refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to live, when he could not do it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly. <hi>Skinder Baſſa,</hi> either grown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie by the acceſſion of this Victory, or that ſome Great Ones at Court were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily emulous of his Glory, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted many Enemies near the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> who upon all occaſions did him ill offices: but finding that Infection to work ſlowly, they corrupted ſome of his neareſt Servants, who by the Infuſion of Poyſon in his Drinks, deſtroyed him ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly; ſo that he did not long ſurvive the unfortunate <hi>Zolkievius:</hi> being in this more unfortunate, that he died in the quality of a Criminal, and that no certain account can be given of him, but that he died in the year 1620.</p>
            <p>And having by this digreſſion given the Reader a ſhort ſurvey of this great Action, which wanted only one moment more of Succeſs to render it the moſt glorious that any Age had produced; we will return to the continuation of our Hiſtory where we left, which was the condition of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Garriſon in the Palace of <hi>Musko;</hi> who being grown weary with their unprofitable ſtrivings, had taken a riſe from their ill
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93173:121"/>Pay, to propoſe Terms for their diſmiſſion. Their General <hi>Goziowski</hi> uſed all his Arts to quiet them; and having the Treaſure of the Empire in his poſſeſſion, he reſolved to Sacrifice that to their Avarice. There was amongſt other things in the Treaſury a Statue of our <hi>SAVIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R,</hi> of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a man, weighing C C C <hi>lib.</hi> of maſſive Gold; which the Souldiers mangled into parcels, not making their dividend ſo exactly by Rule, but that every one got what he could. <hi>Baſilius Zuiski,</hi> in his ſhort Reign, had deſtroyed the Twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, being compoſed of the ſame Mettle and largeneſs. And this part of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army deſpairing of relief, were become careleſs of that Repreſentation of Chriſt which by the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were uſed to worſhip. Their General having by this and other divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dends out of the Treaſury appeaſed, though not ſatisfied, his Army for the preſent though what by an equal eſtimate migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93173:121"/>of a powerful relief in ſhort time; and that his Souldiers might not be diſuſed to beat the <hi>Muskovites,</hi> he made frequent advantageous Sallies upon them. There was in that part of the City which had been waſted by the fire, a houſe in which the Magazine of Salt had been laid up, which having eſcaped the fury of that mercileſs Element, was become a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Commodity to both Parties. It lay more under the Command of the <hi>Poles</hi> than the City; but <hi>Gariowski,</hi> becauſe he would have ſomewhat for his Army to do, forbore to bring it in to his Garriſon but as he had daily uſe for it; this gave his men conſtant imployment: for what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their own wants and thoſe of the Enemy, they had perpetual Skirmiſhes; wherein for the moſt part they came off with the advantage, but that the waſting of their men was an incurable evil, for which they had no remedy. <hi>Gariowski</hi> made uſe of all his Arts, and had recourſe to yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fineſſes:</hi> he laid a train for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Lepanow</hi> the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> General, by cauſing Letters to be diſperſed in his name into the ſeveral Provinces, requiring them to Maſſacre all the <hi>Dunenſian Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> in their Quarters, as deſigning a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:93173:122"/>and too paſſionately promoters of the intereſt of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to which they had always adhered. One of theſe Packets being put into <hi>Sidorus</hi> his hand (he was General of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi>) ſo terrified him (that believing what he feared) and too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the danger, he reſolv'd to prevent it; in order whereto, having conſulted the Principal Officers in ſo weighty an affair, they all concluded to anticipate their own Fate by <hi>Lepanow</hi>'s fall; and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereupon mutined; their Souldiers tranſported with the apprehenſion of their imaginary peril: whereupon <hi>Lepanow</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to appeaſe the Tumult, being no way warned of his own danger, was overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſlain upon the place. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral being thus removed, the <hi>Muskovites</hi> gave the Command of their Army to <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becius;</hi> who being more wary of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices of <hi>Gaziowski,</hi> which by this time had taken air, cauſed ſome of his Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who were found tampering afreſh with the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> to be ſeiſed upon; and to render the cheat more publike, had them put to death with exquiſite Torments: And after the Kings departure from <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko,</hi> applied himſelf ſo vigorouſly in proſecution of the Siege, preſſing ſo hard
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93173:122"/>upon the <hi>Poles,</hi> that he ſhut them up cloſe within their Fortifications. And now they were out of all hope of any relief, and ſo cloſely pent up, that they began to want every thing neceſſary for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. They endured theſe hardſhips ſeven full weeks, after which time they were delivered by a Miracle on the 15th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> as one of their Prieſts had foretold. Before they were reduced to this narrow compaſs, they had ſent all their Boys and Servants out, to the number of betwixt three and four thouſand upon a Party, for forrage. Theſe by the time of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, found all the Avenues ſhut up. At firſt they were upon thoughts of retiring and ſhifting for themſelves, until detained with the ſhame of abandoning their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters without attempting their relief, they took new courage and reſolutions to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to force the Paſſage. Being thus animated, having ſome Souldiers amongſt them, they drew up into as large a front as they could, extending their Wings to a great diſtance, and advancing up within ſight of the Leaguer upon that ſide where the <hi>Moska</hi> runs, put themſelves into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to paſs it; which they did without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and were received into the Fortreſs
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93173:123"/>with the acclamations of the Beſieged, and the congratulations of their Maſters. The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> had been ſurprized with this unexpected relief, as they termed it; and having had no room left in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions for the exerciſe of their courage, concluded that the whole force of <hi>Poland</hi> was at their backs; which obliged them to quit their Trenches on that ſide of the Town, and leave an open and uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Paſſage for the Boys to enter at. The Beſieged taking the opportunity of their Enemies fears, made a ſeaſonable Sally, whereby they reduced all thoſe Forts and Out-works which had been formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, enlarging their Quarters to a more commodious diſtance. But all this being conſidered by them but as a ſmall intermiſſion of their miſeries, and no ſolid Supply able to ſuſtain the force of all <hi>Muskovy,</hi> they diſpatched Letters to their King in <hi>Poland</hi> with an account of their condition, upbraiding his careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſafety; and declaring, that if by the 6th of <hi>Jan.</hi> their Prince were not ſent to them, they would quit the place, and come back to <hi>Poland</hi> to require their Arrears. The Chief Officers of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, by a miſunderſtanding amongſt
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93173:123"/>themſelves, contributed unhappily to the Service of the <hi>Ruſſians. Potocki</hi> Palatine of <hi>Brachlaw</hi> was left Governour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Forces about <hi>Smolensko;</hi> but he could not ſuffer that <hi>Charles Chodkievi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> Lieutenant-General of the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Army ſhould be ſent to proſecute the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the <hi>Muskovitiſh</hi> War, as to the poſſeſſion of the Imperial Seat, towards the gaining of which he had contributed little; and reckoning upon this as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne fit to be reſerved for his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, he managed all his Counſels accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: and though <hi>Chodkievits</hi> was, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all his contrivements, marked out for the Service of <hi>Musko,</hi> yet the enraged <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocki</hi> perverted ſome of his Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and as it happened there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Cauſes to thwart the <hi>Poliſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: for upon the 15th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> it ſeemed more than probable that the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kovites</hi> being hotly purſued, might have been driven out of the City, but that an old Colonel amongſt the <hi>Poles</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if they ſhould improve this Succeſs to the utmoſt, there would be nothing left for their General <hi>Chodkievits</hi> to do (upon whom this Colonel had a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and it ſeems conſulted his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93173:124"/>more than the Common Good) and therefore diſſwaded his Party from preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Fortune upon an apprehenſion of ſome ſuppoſed dangers. In the mean time <hi>Chodkievits</hi> being deſign'd for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the place, marcht thither with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but the fame of his ſevere Diſcipline flying thither before him, and augmented by the envy of his ill-willers, begot a very great prejudice in the minds of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers againſt him, and an averſion for him; ſo that they upon his arrival diſputed his Commands, and looking upon all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals with an eye of diffidence, would not be engaged upon any more Sallies; but as if they had placed a Religion in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their former Letter to the King, they quitted the Palace upon the ſixth of <hi>Jan.</hi> as they had before declared.</p>
            <p>They left indeed the <hi>Sapihan</hi> Regiment in Garriſon behind them, but upon the Temptation of vaſt advantages. Theſe had the reſt of the Crown-Jewels put into their hands, as caution for their pay: which Jewels conſiſted of two Crowns of Gold richly beſet with Jems, a Scepter of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns-Horn likewiſe gloriouſly adorned with Jewels; two whole Unicorns-horns, and another half cut; the Great Dukes
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93173:124"/>Saddle embroydered with Pearl and Gold; two Hats wrought with Diamonds, with the Scepter and Golden Apple, both inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pretious Stones of huge value. And having ordered the Affairs of the Fort at this rate, they choſe one <hi>Joſeph Cieclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski</hi> for their General, and appointing him a new Council of War, they quitted the place, notwithſtanding the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and the intreaties and threats of their Officers to the contrary, and marched directly into <hi>Poland,</hi> being 7000 effective Horſe; and being arrived at <hi>Leopolis,</hi> made that their Head-Quarters: and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Troops into the ſeveral Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates of the leſſer <hi>Poland,</hi> they ſeiſed upon the Kings Domains, and the Eccleſiaſtical Revenues, which were very great, under pretence of their Arrears due from the Commonwealth. But to return to <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko</hi> which they had quitted; the <hi>Sapihan</hi> Regiment which they had left there, was reinforced and reaſſured by the acceſs of freſh Troops brought thither by the two <hi>Konickspolski</hi>'s from <hi>Smolensko;</hi> but they were followed by an envy amongſt the Great Officers, as their evil Genius. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocki</hi> led on by his Ambition, which had an influence upon all his Councils, having
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93173:125"/>ſuffered affairs to run up to a pitch of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, judged it a fit time for him to ſtep in to the preſervation of the place; in order whereto, he ſent his Kinſman <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Struſius</hi> with part of the <hi>Smolenskian</hi> Foot, as moſt proper for the Service in Garriſon. The Paſſage along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Moſcha</hi> was kept open all this time, whereby they were able to receive in their ſupplies of Men and Victuals in ſpite of the Beſiegers; but their diviſions and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions within growing up to a height, gave the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> the opportunity to perfect their Line by blocking up that Paſſage. Not long after, the <hi>Sapihan</hi> Regiment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 4000 Horſe, debauched likewiſe by the ſame ſpirit of Mutiny, forſook <hi>Chod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiowits,</hi> and chuſing one <hi>John Zalinski</hi> to Command them by the Title of Marſhal, took the opportunity of breaking through the Enemies Leaguer, and marching into <hi>Lithuania,</hi> ſeated themſelves at <hi>Breſtia,</hi> where they fixed; dividing the neighbour-Palatinates, the Kings Revenues, and the Eccleſiaſtical Incomes as a ſubſiſtance for themſelves, till their Arrears were paid. The Commonwealth of <hi>Poland</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by theſe repeated inſolencies of their Souldiers, failed not to charge their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93173:125"/>King with the cauſes of them, in not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his Son to go to <hi>Musko,</hi> which he was now inclined to; and though dilato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his nature, reſolved now to bring him thither in Perſon. The Confederate Horſe which had formerly deſired <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaws</hi> with ſo much heat, and in which the King confided moſt, refuſed now to ſtir, and change their repoſe and affluence of all things, for penury and new toils. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund</hi> however, with what Forces he could get together, came to <hi>Vilna</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> where two <hi>German</hi> Regiments of Foot were newly arrived; from thence he went by ſlow Marches to <hi>Smolensko,</hi> where encountring with new difficulties, he was at a ſtand for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of his Deſign: for the Horſe which quartered there (his beſt hopes) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to march with him till their Arrears were paid them. The diſpute was unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to the Kings Affairs, who wanted Monies to anſwer their demands, and ſtrength to exact their Obedience. He therefore had recourſe to entreaties, and the temptation of fair Promiſes (not only Arrears, but Rewards) which having no impreſſion upon their hardened natures, the King was forced to march with his
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93173:126"/>Guards onely, and a few Light-Horſe; though he was after overtaken by twelve hundred of thoſe Horſe, who, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome Officers moſt in credit with them, not to expoſe their King now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Criſis</hi> of his Affairs, but to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to the world by that Act of Obedience both their Loyalty and Courage. Theſe being overcome by ſuch Arguments, marched after the King to <hi>Viaſna,</hi> midway betwixt <hi>Smolensko</hi> and <hi>Musko,</hi> where <hi>Chodkiovits</hi> alſo with his Forces joyned the Royal Army.</p>
            <p>It happened (and I would not omit a circumſtance that carried noiſe with it) that the Portcullis of the Kings Gate at <hi>Smolensko</hi> through which <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> was to go, fell down at that inſtant, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up the Paſſage with its bulk, in ſo much that it could not be removed by any force, ſo that he was forced to turn back and go another way; which was eſteemed by ſome as an inauſpicious <hi>Omen,</hi> that the Royal way to the Empire of <hi>Musko</hi> ſhould not be opened by him. During theſe Traverſes at Court and in the Camp, the Siege is preſſed on at <hi>Musko</hi> with more fervour than before. <hi>Chodkiewits</hi> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the departure of the <hi>Sapihan</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:93173:126"/>Horſe, could not ſuffice to hinder their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, wanting Foot to oppoſe their raiſing of Sconces and Redoubts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they very much ſtreightned the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. However, he did in ſpite of them bring in, by the Aid of his Horſe, ſupplies of Proviſion for the Garriſon that whole Summer; and in <hi>September,</hi> though all ways of communication were obſtructed, and the Garriſon reduced to extreme want, he forced the Guards by that way which he had formerly entred, and brought in a ſmall quantity of Proviſions; which bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no proportion with the neceſſities of the place, he made a new ſupply of four hundred Waggons laden with all manner of neceſſaries, which he attempted to put into the Caſtle by the ſame way of the River, where the <hi>Muskovites</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him with their whole Power. The diſpute was long and obſtinate, where the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe were much inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienced by the diſadvantages of rubbiſh, and other difficultie that hindered them to effect what they had ſo bravely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. <hi>Struſius</hi> was blamed for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advanced with his Foot to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue of the Horſe which fought ſo well;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93173:127"/>but whatever the fault was, all hopes of Conquering the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Empire vaniſhed with this diſgrace; and all the fruit of ſo many Victories, of ſo much Blood, and of ſo much Treaſure as had been expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this War, was loſt in the misfortune of that day: for before <hi>Chodkievicius</hi> could gather new Proviſions, and open a Paſſage to the Caſtle now more carefully fortified and warded than formerly; the Beſieged having conſumed every thing that was edible, eaten all their Horſes, Cats, Dogs, Rats, Mice, Leather, Covers of Books and Trunks, and whatever elſe they could deviſe to get into their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, proceeded to humane fleſh, ready to feed upon one another, as if they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred that to a ſurrender: but the latter prevailed at laſt over their obſtinacie, and they yielded themſelves and the place up at diſcretion.</p>
            <p>The King was at <hi>Viaſna</hi> when news of this fatal Surrender reacht him; and being by that time become ſenſible of this great blow to his Affairs and Intereſt, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted what was to be done; whether to retire as from a baffled deſigne, or to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance further, upon a computation that the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93173:127"/>
               <hi>Muskovites</hi> being yet in diſorder, might be over-awed by the preſence of him and his Army, and might thereby be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to receive his Son for Emperor; at leaſt he propoſed to himſelf an advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Peace: and this latter Counſel prevailing, he continued his March till he arrived at <hi>Fedorouſcum;</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the <hi>Smolenskian</hi> Horſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed forward, they advanced to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Walls of <hi>Musko;</hi> but inſtead of any Parley, or other addreſs to them, they were received with ſhot from the City, and a furious Salley, which obliged them to draw off to places of more ſafety. The King was likewiſe diſappointed in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, the Country ſtanding upon their Guards, as having an Enemy in their Bowels; carried all their Proviſions into Garriſons and fenced Places; in ſo much that what with that, and the impreſſions of the Winter, he was much diſtreſſed for Forrage for his Horſe; and being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to lie in the Field, it was more than his Army could endure in that ſeaſon. The <hi>Poles</hi> enraged at this evil poſture of their Affairs, and to revenge the Indignity, as they called it, aſſaulted the Town of <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loc,</hi>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:93173:128"/>but in vain; ſo that having no choice left them, they returned back by the way of <hi>Smolensko</hi> into <hi>Poland.</hi> And thus ended the Expedition of King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> the Election of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaws,</hi> and the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Endeavours of the two <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s, the cauſes of ſo many Viciſſitudes and Calamities.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Muskovites</hi> being by the retreat of the <hi>Poles</hi> reſtored to a ſtate of quietneſs, conſulted the ſettlement of their Empire, by ſuch an Election as might beſt tend to it: and having looked about them for a fit Perſon to place upon the Throne of their ſhattered Dominions, the univerſal Suffrage fell upon <hi>Michael Federowicz,</hi> Son to the Patriarch of <hi>Roſtock,</hi> who was at that time detained Priſoner in <hi>Marieburg</hi>-Caſtle; Him they Crowned with one of the Diadems which they found amongſt the Rapines of the <hi>Poles;</hi> fought conſtantly for him, and forced the Enemy, after many and Bloody Conflicts, to abdicate their pretended Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and to emancipate them from the Sacrament of that Oath which they had Sworn to Prince <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaws.</hi> That ſame Winter, to ſtrike at the Root of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:93173:128"/>his Pretenſions, they attempted his Remnant enquartered about <hi>Caluga.</hi> The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> being overcome by the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kovites</hi> Gold, delivered the unfortunate <hi>Marina</hi> with her Son into their hands; who, to deſtroy all Colour of future Claims from that Intereſt, made the Water her Grave, thruſting her and her Son under the Ice, into that deſtroying Element, where ſhe and her hopes ſunk together; as if nothing leſs than an Ocean could ſuffice to ſatisfie the thirſt of her Ambition. I am not ignorant that <hi>Kobierzickius</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaws</hi> delivers, that ſhe was ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Great Dukes Command, and her Son hanged. However it was, ſhe was a Lady of an immenſe Spirit, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind above her Sex. All other conſiderations in her, gave place to her aſpiring thoughts, which ſwayed her as the only Pilot of her Soul. The deſire of Empire did ſo eat out her joys, that ſhe was ſeldom happy; and though her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes were not of a common rank, yet the greatneſs of her Conſtancie as well as Courage, ſeemed to brave them. She ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the thought of being treated in her loweſt Condition at a leſs rate than as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs:
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93173:129"/>upon which ſcore it was obſerved, that ſhe ſlighted the Letters of a near Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who coming with King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> into <hi>Muskovy,</hi> judged it fit to adviſe her, that ſhe ſhould caſt her ſelf upon the Kings Clemencie: But ſhe reflecting upon the omiſſion of her Titles (which 'tis like her Kinſman forbore upon an accompt of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and not to perplex his Paper with hard Names) anſwered, <hi>She did not doubt, but that God the Avenger of Injuries, would be yet propitious to her afflictions:</hi> She ſaid nothing of the King, as not approving of his coming into <hi>Muskovy;</hi> but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the omiſſion of her Titles, added with her own hand, <hi>That what God had illuminated, could not be obſcured; and that the Sun, however ſometimes overcaſt with thick Clouds, could never be totally deprived of his light:</hi> and Signed, <hi>The Empreſs Marina.</hi> Some time after, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with ſcorn the offer that the King made her Huſband and her, of the fair Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of <hi>Sambore</hi> and <hi>Grodners,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they would not oppoſe him in his Conqueſt of the Empire, ſending him this anſwer: <hi>That the King ſhould deliver</hi> Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covie <hi>to</hi> Demetrius, <hi>and he might in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93173:129"/>receive</hi> Warſovie <hi>from his Great Duke.</hi> But ſhe is now overwhelmed in another Deluge beſides that of her grief. And the brave, though unconſtant <hi>Zaruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki,</hi> who had adhered to her Fortunes, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling likewiſe into the hands of the Great Duke, was impalled; ſhutting up the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of his Miſtreſs by his own death.</p>
            <p>And now the Competitorſhip upon the accompt of the Blood Royal ſeemed to have extinguiſhed: but as if to be <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> were to be immortal, and that he had not been ſlain, but reſcued yet again; an inconſiderable Scrivener, by what induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſway'd to it is unknown, gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out to be <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Son of <hi>John Baſilius;</hi> and that beſides his deliverance at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>glecz</hi> and <hi>Musko,</hi> he had yet this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miracle of his preſervation at <hi>Caluga.</hi> The Fellow being of a ready Tongue, and ſubtle, got together ſome hundreds of men, ſuch whom the War had indiſpoſed to any thing of labour. And to theſe there flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Vagabonds, Bandites, and idle perſons, the excrements of their late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, that propoſed to themſelves any advantage from Rapine and Plunder. His numbers being by this means increaſed to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93173:130"/>the bulk of a conſiderable Party, he cauſed a Manifeſt to be publiſhed of his Birth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Deliverances, invited all his Loyal Subjects (as he ſtiled them) to that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which they owed to him as Great Duke of <hi>Muskovy,</hi> the only ſurviving Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of <hi>John Baſilius.</hi> And to put the more countenance upon his Impoſture, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Force to <hi>Novogrod,</hi> from thence to <hi>Jama,</hi> and on to <hi>Iwanogrod,</hi> where he was by the giddy multitude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, honoured, and owned as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Demetrius</hi> Great Duke of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kovy.</hi> Having proceeded ſucceſsfully in this great Attempt, he aſſumed yet more ſtate: and to give a becoming Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his pretenſions, he diſpatched an Embaſſy to <hi>Sweden,</hi> to ſollicite aids againſt the Treachery and ill-dealing of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who contrary to all Law Humane and Divine, had ſet up another upon his Throne. King <hi>Charles</hi> ſurprized with this Addreſs, could not ſatisfie his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not ceaſing to admire how that <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> who had been ſo often ſlain, ſhould now ſurvive, to demand his aſſiſtance. But reſolving not to be abuſed or impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he diſpatched <hi>Petreius</hi> as his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:93173:130"/>to <hi>Iwanogrod,</hi> with Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Power to conclude; but firſt exactly to inform himſelf of the truth of all things: And if he found this Perſon to be that real <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who had been acknowledged, Crowned, and Sworn to at <hi>Musko,</hi> then to give him all encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Supplies for the regaining of his Rights, and bringing his Subjects to their due Obedience. <hi>Petreius</hi> being arrived at <hi>Iwanogrod,</hi> could get no Audience from this new Duke: for he being advertiſed that the Embaſſador had formerly ſeen the murthered <hi>Demetrius</hi> both in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Musko,</hi> would by no means admit of him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Preſence; but pretending an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in point of health, referred him to his Council to treat with him, and that he himſelf (hoping he might in a few days be fit for buſineſs) would ratifie the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Perſon. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Embaſſador anſwered, that the King his Maſter deſired to enter into a ſtrict League with the Great Duke, and had therefore given him ſome particular Commands, which he was to communicate to his Highneſs in Perſon; but ſince it was not conſiſtent with his health to receive him into his preſence (he
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93173:131"/>being reſtrained by his Inſtructions not to entruſt his Maſters Secrets to any other) would return for <hi>Sweden;</hi> not doubting, but if the Great Duke ſhould think fit to ſend his Embaſſador thither, but that the King his Maſter would be ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with all his Honorable Deſignes and Deſires. And thus <hi>Petreius</hi> having ended his Negotiation, left the place; gathering from the refuſal of <hi>Demetrius</hi> to admit him into his Preſence, and from other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations made by him, that he was only a fictitious Perſon, who had aſſumed a Name and Title wherewith he had nothing to do.</p>
            <p>But he having by this time got together a Force, which might well enough bear the reputation of an Army, took the Field; and upon the 24th of <hi>June</hi> faced <hi>Pleſchow,</hi> a conſiderable place; which being ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Name of the Great Duke <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> was upon the point of ſurrendring; when the <hi>Muskovitiſh</hi> Army advancing, he made a haſty retreat, leaving behind him his Cannon, and moſt of his Baggage; and being followed by them, he hardly eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to <hi>Iwanogrod.</hi> The <hi>Ruſſians</hi> having with ſo much eaſe, and without a blow,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93173:131"/>diſperſed this new Army, careleſs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the ſucceſs further, retired. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Inhabitants of <hi>Pleſcow</hi> diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Deputies to <hi>Iwanogrod,</hi> with an humble offer to this <hi>Pſeudo-Demetrius</hi> of their Town and Services, as their Prince and Sovereign. He over-joy'd with this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Succeſs, went immediately away for <hi>Pleſcow</hi> with the Embaſſadors; where he was received with all the imaginable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of Joy, Honor, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He tranſported with this Progreſs in his Affairs, and not capable of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame to his advantage, gave himſelf up to all manner of licentiouſneſs and luſt, violating many of the Prime Citizens Wives and Daughters; and proceeding from one degree of Debauchery to another, he let looſe the Reins to his Party, who by his Example committed all manner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies and Villanies upon the people. The <hi>Pleſcovites</hi> tired out, and provoked with the barbarous behaviour of their Prince, took Arms, beat his Guards, and forced him to fly the City for his ſafety. The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> ſeeing him thus forſaken of all, reſolved alſo to leave him; but ſome of them more adviſed, conſidered of ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93173:132"/>upon his Perſon, whereby they might the better make their own peace. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of this Deſigne, being well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, clapped Spurs to his Horſe; and had undoubtedly eſcaped their hands, but that he was overtaken by an Arrow out of a <hi>Coſſack</hi>-Bowe, which wounded him in the ſhoulder. Hereupon he was taken; and being bound hand and foot, was ſent to <hi>Pleskow,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Musko,</hi> where he was tied by a great Chain to one of the Gates, remaining there an object of ſcorn and reproach to all the world, until the Coronation of <hi>Michael Federowicz,</hi> by whoſe Command this laſt <hi>Pſeudo-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> the fictitious Son of <hi>Jo. Baſilius,</hi> was hanged in publick: This Muſhrome, after it had but peeped up, expiring with ſhame and infamy.</p>
